(“Netflix”, “the Company”, “registrant”, “we”, or “us”) is one of the world’s leading entertainment services with approximately 302 million paid memberships in over 190 countries enjoying TV series, films and games across a wide variety of genres and languages. Members can play, pause and resume watching as much as they want, anytime, anywhere, and can change their plans at any time.\n\nOur core strategy is to grow our business globally within the parameters of our operating margin target. We strive to continuously improve our members\' experience by offering compelling content that delights them and attracts new members. We aim to offer a range of pricing plans, including our ad-supported subscription plan, to meet a variety of consumer needs. We seek to drive conversation around our content to further enhance member joy, and we are continuously enhancing our user interface to help our members more easily choose content that they will find enjoyable.\n\nBUSINESS SEGMENTS\n\nWe operate as one operating segment. Our revenues are primarily derived from monthly membership fees for services related to streaming content to our members. See Note 12, Segment and Geographic Information, in the accompanying notes to our consolidated financial statements for further detail.\n\nCOMPETITION\n\nThe market for entertainment video is intensely competitive and subject to rapid change. We compete with a broad set of activities for consumers’ leisure time, including other entertainment video providers, such as linear television, streaming entertainment providers (including those that provide pirated content), video gaming providers, as well as user-generated content, some of which are by professional content creators, and more broadly against other sources of entertainment, such as social media, that our members could choose in their moments of free time. We also compete against entertainment video providers and content producers in obtaining content for our service, both for licensed content and for original content projects.\n\nWhile consumers may maintain simultaneous relationships with multiple entertainment sources, we strive for consumers to choose us in their moments of free time. We have often referred to this choice as our objective of "winning moments of truth." In attempting to win these moments of truth with our members, we seek to continually improve our service, including both our technology and our content offerings.\n\nSEASONALITY\n\nOur membership growth exhibits a seasonal pattern that reflects variations when consumers buy internet-connected screens and when they tend to increase their viewing. Historically, the fourth quarter represents our greatest streaming membership growth. In addition, our membership growth can be impacted by our content release schedule and changes to pricing and plans.\n\n1', 'Table of Contents\n\nINTELLECTUAL PROPERTY\n\nWe regard our trademarks, service marks, copyrights, patents, domain names, trade dress, trade secrets, proprietary technologies and similar intellectual property as important to our success. We use a combination of patent, trademark, copyright and trade secret laws and confidentiality agreements to protect our proprietary intellectual property. Our intellectual property rights extend to our technology, business processes, the content we produce and distribute through our service, and the consumer products and experiences based thereon. We use the intellectual property of third parties in creating some of our content, merchandising our products and marketing our service. Our ability to provide our members with content they can watch depends on studios, content providers and other rights holders licensing rights, including distribution rights, to such content and certain related elements thereof, such as the public performance of music contained within the content we distribute. The license periods and the terms and conditions of such licenses vary. Our ability to protect and enforce our intellectual property rights is subject to certain risks and from time to time we encounter disputes over rights and obligations concerning intellectual property. We cannot provide assurance that we will prevail in any intellectual property disputes.\n\nREGULATION\n\nThe media landscape and the internet delivery of content have seen growing regulatory action. Historically, media has been highly regulated in many countries. We are seeing some of these legacy regulatory frameworks be updated and expanded to address services like ours. In particular, we are seeing some countries update their cultural support legislation to include services like Netflix. This includes content quotas, levies and investment obligations. Some even restrict the extent of ownership rights we can have both in our service and in our content. In certain countries, regulators are also looking at restrictions that could require formal reviews of and/or adjustments to content that appears on our service in their country. In general these regulations impact all services and may make operating in certain jurisdictions more expensive or restrictive as to the content offerings we may provide.\n\nHUMAN CAPITAL\n\nWe view our employees and our culture as key to our success. As of December\xa031, 2024, we had approximately 14,000 full-time employees. Of these, approximately 9,600 (69%) were located in the United States and Canada, 2,200 (16%) in Europe, Middle East, and Africa, 600 (4%) in Latin America and 1,600 (11%) in Asia-Pacific. We also have a number of employees engaged in content production, some of whom are part-time or temporary, and whose numbers fluctuate throughout the year and may be covered by collective bargaining agreements. We believe an important component of our success is our company culture. This culture, which is detailed in a "Culture Memo" located on our website, is often described as providing a unique environment for our employees to perform the best work of their lives in pursuit of excellence. We aim to attract and retain great people - representing a diverse array of perspectives and skills - to work together as a dream team. As our business grows and changes, we seek to improve our culture to meet the new needs of our business. We believe our dynamic culture helps us create a better experience for our members, employees, creators and partners.\n\nAs we have expanded our offices globally, our company culture remains an important aspect of our operations. We are mindful of cultural differences across and within regions. Fostering a work environment that is culturally diverse, inclusive and equitable is a major focus for us. We work to build diversity, inclusion and equity into all aspects of our operations globally, with the goal of having diversity and inclusion function as a critical lens through which each Netflix employee carries out their role. We want more people and cultures to see themselves reflected on screen - so it’s important that our employee base is diverse and represents the communities we serve. We look to help increase representation by educating our people leaders and recruiters on how to hire more inclusively, and to help the company and senior leaders diversify their networks. We also support numerous employee resource groups (ERGs), representing employees and allies from a broad array of historically underrepresented and/or marginalized communities. We publish annually an update on our inclusion initiatives and progress, which further highlights our approach to diversity and inclusion, and publish our EEO-1 reports on our website.\n\nWe believe in fostering great leaders. We offer various experiences and training to inform our employees about our culture and other context that we believe is important for success at Netflix. We aim to equip our people leaders (officers, VPs, directors, and manager-level employees) to lead the business and our teams in alignment with our expectations and strategic objectives.\n\nWe aim generally to pay our employees at their personal top of market, and they generally are able to choose the form of their compensation between cash and stock options. This permits employee compensation to be highly personalized and reflective of each employee\'s individual needs and preferences. We conduct pay equity analyses at least annually, and have adopted practices to help ensure that employees from underrepresented groups are not being underpaid based on gender identity (globally) and race or ethnicity (U.S.) relative to others doing the same or similar work under comparable circumstances. We aim to rectify any pay gaps that we find through this analysis.\n\nWe care about the health and well-being of our employees and their families and provide a variety of benefit programs based on region, including health benefits. In the U.S., employees generally receive an annual cash health benefit allowance that they may allocate to medical, dental and vision premiums in a way that makes sense for them. Employees have access to a host of other benefits, including mental health, childcare, family planning and a company match for charitable donations.\n\nWe believe that our approach to human capital resources has been instrumental in our growth, and has made Netflix a desirable destination for employees.\n\n2', 'Table of Contents\n\nOTHER INFORMATION\n\nWe maintain a website at www.netflix.com. The contents of our website are not incorporated in, or otherwise to be regarded as part of, this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We make available, free of charge on our website, access to our Annual Report on Form 10-K, our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, our Current Reports on Form 8-K and amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), as soon as reasonably practicable after we file or furnish them electronically with the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC").\n\nInvestors and others should note that we announce material financial and other information to our investors using our investor relations website (ir.netflix.net), SEC filings, press releases, public conference calls and webcasts. We use these channels as well as social media and blogs to communicate with our members and the public about our company, our services and other issues. It is possible that the information we post on social media and blogs could be deemed to be material information. Therefore, we encourage investors, the media, and others interested in our company to review the information we post on the social media channels and blogs listed on our investor relations website.\n\n3', 'Table of Contents\n\nItem 1A.Risk Factors\n\nIf any of the following risks actually occur, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be harmed. In that case, the trading price of our common stock could decline, and you could lose all or part of your investment.\n\nRisks Related to Our Business\n\nIf our efforts to attract and retain members are not successful, our business will be adversely affected.\n\nWe must continually add new members both to replace canceled memberships and to grow our business beyond our current membership base. Our ability to continue to attract and retain members will depend in part on our ability to consistently provide our members in countries around the globe with compelling content choices that keep our members engaged with our service, effectively drive conversation around our content and service, as well as provide a quality experience for choosing and enjoying TV series, films and games. Our penetration and growth rates have fluctuated and vary across the jurisdictions where we provide our service. In countries where we have been operating for many years or where we are highly penetrated, our membership growth is slower than in newer or less penetrated countries. Furthermore, the relative service levels, content offerings, pricing and related features of competitors to our service may adversely impact our ability to attract and retain members. Competitors include other entertainment video providers, such as linear television, and streaming entertainment providers (including those that provide pirated content), video gaming providers, as well as user-generated content, some of which are by professional content creators, and more broadly other sources of entertainment, such as social media, that our members could choose in their moments of free time.\n\nMembers cancel our service for many reasons, including a perception that they do not use the service sufficiently, that they need to cut household expenses, dissatisfaction with content, a preference for competitive services and customer service issues that they believe are not satisfactorily resolved. Membership growth is also impacted by seasonality, with the fourth quarter historically representing our greatest growth, as well as the timing of our content release schedules. Adverse macroeconomic conditions, including inflation, may also adversely impact our ability to attract and retain members. If we do not grow as expected, given, in particular, that our content costs are largely fixed in nature, we may not be able to adjust our expenditures or increase our (per membership) revenues, including by adjusting membership pricing, commensurate with the lowered growth rate such that our margins, liquidity and results of operations may be adversely impacted. If we are unable to successfully compete with current and new competitors in providing compelling content, retaining our existing members and attracting new members, our business will be adversely affected.\n\nIf we do not continuously provide value to our members, including making improvements to our service in a manner that is favorably received by them, our revenue, results of operations and business will be adversely affected.\n\nIf consumers do not perceive our service offering to be of value, including if we introduce new or adjust existing features, adjust pricing or service offerings, or change the mix of content in a manner that is not favorably received by them, we may not be able to attract and retain members, and accordingly, our revenue and results of operations may be adversely affected. We expanded our entertainment video offering to include games and, more recently, live programming. If our efforts to sustain and improve our existing TV and film offering, as well as develop and expand our video entertainment options, are not done in a manner valued by our current and future members, our ability to attract and retain members may be negatively impacted. We may also seek to extend our business into new products and services to help drive growth. For example, we continue to expand our offering of consumer products and live experiences. To the extent we cannot successfully find and develop new products, experiences and services to help drive growth, or we do not realize the expected benefits or generate additional revenue from such new products, experiences, and services, our future results of operations and growth may be adversely impacted.\n\nWe have and may, from time to time, adjust our membership pricing, our membership plans, or our pricing model itself, including for example, the lower-priced ad-supported subscription plan. Similarly, we have increased enforcement of and will continue to enforce our terms of use to limit multi-household usage and shared viewing outside of a household. These and other adjustments we make may not be well-received by consumers, and could negatively impact our ability to attract and retain members, revenue and our results of operations. In addition, many of our members rejoin our service or originate from word-of-mouth advertising from existing members. If our efforts to satisfy our existing members or adjustments to our service are not successful, we may not be able to attract or retain members, and as a result, our ability to maintain and/or grow our business will be adversely affected.\n\nChanges in competitive offerings for entertainment video could adversely impact our business.\n\nThe market for entertainment is intensely competitive and subject to rapid change. Through new and existing distribution channels, consumers have increasing options to access entertainment video. The various economic models underlying these channels include subscription, transactional, ad-supported and piracy-based models. All of these have the potential to capture meaningful segments of the entertainment video market. We face competition from traditional providers of entertainment video, including broadcasters and cable network operators, as well as internet based e-commerce or entertainment video providers and platforms. Several of these competitors have long operating histories, large customer bases, strong brand recognition, exclusive rights to certain content, large content libraries, and significant\n\n4', 'Table of Contents\n\nfinancial, marketing and other resources. They may offer more compelling content or secure better terms from suppliers, adopt more aggressive pricing and devote more resources to product development, technology, infrastructure, content acquisitions and marketing. New entrants may enter the market or existing providers may adjust their services with unique offerings or approaches to providing entertainment video. In addition, new technological developments, including the development and use of generative artificial intelligence, are rapidly evolving. If our competitors gain an advantage by using such technologies more effectively to satisfy consumer demand, our ability to compete successfully and our results of operations could be adversely impacted. Companies also may enter into business combinations or alliances that strengthen their competitive positions. Piracy also threatens to damage our business, as its fundamental proposition to consumers is so compelling and difficult to compete against: virtually all content for free. In light of the compelling consumer proposition, piracy services are subject to rapid global growth, and our efforts to prevent that growth may be insufficient. If we are unable to successfully or profitably compete with current and new competitors and win moments of truth, our business will be adversely affected, and we may not be able to increase or maintain market share, revenues or profitability.\n\nWe face risks, such as unforeseen costs and potential liability in connection with content we acquire, produce, license and/or distribute through our service.\n\nAs a producer and distributor of content, we face potential liability for negligence, copyright and trademark infringement, or other claims based on the nature and content of materials that we acquire, produce, license and/or distribute. We also may face potential liability for content used in promoting our service, including marketing materials. We devote significant resources toward the development, production, marketing and distribution of original programming. We believe that original and exclusive programming can help differentiate our service from other offerings, enhance our brand and otherwise attract and retain members. To the extent our programming does not meet our expectations, in particular, in terms of costs, viewing and popularity, our business, including our brand and results of operations may be adversely impacted. As a content producer, we are responsible for production costs and other expenses, such as ongoing guild payments, and take on risks associated with production, such as completion and key talent risk. Further, negotiations or renewals related to entertainment industry collective bargaining agreements have, and in the future, could negatively impact timing and costs associated with our productions. We contract with third parties related to the development, production, marketing and distribution of our original programming. We may face potential liability or may suffer significant losses in connection with these arrangements, including but not limited to if such third parties violate applicable law, become insolvent or engage in fraudulent behavior. To the extent we create and sell physical or digital merchandise relating to our programming, and/or license such rights to third parties, we could become subject to product liability, intellectual property or other claims related to such merchandise. We may decide to remove content from our service, not to place licensed or produced content on our service or discontinue or alter production of original content if we believe such content might not be well received by our members, is prohibited by law, or could be damaging to our brand or business.\n\nTo the extent we do not accurately anticipate costs or mitigate risks, including for content that we obtain but ultimately does not appear on or is removed from our service, or if we become liable for content we acquire, produce, license and/or distribute, our business may suffer. Litigation to defend these claims could be costly and the expenses and damages arising from any liability or unforeseen production risks could harm our results of operations. We may not be indemnified against claims or costs of these types and we may not have insurance coverage for these types of claims.\n\nIf we are not able to manage change and growth, our business could be adversely affected.\n\nWe are expanding our operations, scaling our streaming service to effectively and reliably handle anticipated growth in both members and features related to our services, such as introducing games and advertising on our service, as well as offering live programming and expanding our consumer products and experiences. We are also scaling our own studio operations to produce original content. As our international offering evolves, we are managing and adjusting our business to address varied content offerings, consumer customs and practices, in particular those dealing with e-commerce and streaming video, as well as differing legal and regulatory environments. As we scale our streaming service and introduce new features such as our ad-supported subscription plan and live programming, we are developing technology and utilizing third-party “cloud” computing, technology and other services. As we scale our content production, including games, and introduce new features and expand our consumer products and experience offerings, we are building out expertise in a number of disciplines, including creative, marketing, legal, finance, licensing, merchandising and other resources, which requires significant resources and management attention. Further, we may expand our content and service offerings in a manner that is not well received by consumers. As we grow our operations, we may face integration and operational challenges as well as potential unknown liabilities and reputational concerns in connection with partners we work with or companies we may acquire or control. If we are not able to manage the growing complexity of our business, including improving, refining or evolving our corporate culture, as well as our systems and operational practices related to our streaming operations and original content, our business may be adversely affected.\n\nIf we fail to maintain a positive reputation concerning our service and the content we offer, we may not be able to attract or retain members, we may face regulatory scrutiny and our operating results may be adversely affected.\n\nWe believe that a positive reputation concerning our service is important in attracting and retaining members. To the extent our content is perceived as low quality, offensive or otherwise not compelling to consumers, our ability to establish and maintain a positive reputation may be adversely impacted. To the extent our content is deemed controversial or offensive by government regulators, we may face direct or indirect\n\n5', "Table of Contents\n\nretaliatory action or behavior, including being required to remove such content from our service, our entire service could be banned and/or become subject to heightened regulatory scrutiny across our business and operations. We could also face boycotts which could adversely affect our business. Furthermore, to the extent our response to government action or our marketing, customer service and public relations efforts are not effective or result in negative reaction, our ability to establish and maintain a positive reputation may likewise be adversely impacted. There is an increasing focus from regulators, investors, members and other stakeholders on environmental, social, and governance (“ESG”) matters, both in the United States and internationally, including the adoption of new disclosure and regulatory frameworks. To the extent we are unable to meet regulatory or industry standards or investor expectations on ESG issues or the content we distribute and the manner in which we produce content creates ESG related concerns, our reputation may be harmed.\n\nOur business could be adversely impacted by costs and challenges associated with strategic acquisitions and investments.\n\nFrom time to time, we acquire or invest in businesses, content, and technologies that support our business. The risks associated with such acquisitions or investments (some of which may be unforeseen) include the difficulty of integrating solutions, operations, and personnel; inheriting liabilities and exposure to litigation; failure to realize anticipated benefits and expected synergies; and diversion of management’s time and attention, among other acquisition-related risks.\n\nWe may not be successful in overcoming such risks, and such acquisitions and investments may negatively impact our business. In addition, if we do not complete an announced acquisition transaction or integrate an acquired business successfully and in a timely manner, we may not realize the benefits of the acquisition to the extent anticipated. Acquisitions and investments may contribute to fluctuations in our quarterly financial results. These fluctuations could arise from transaction-related costs and charges associated with eliminating redundant expenses or write-offs of impaired assets recorded in connection with acquisitions and investments, and could negatively impact our financial results.\n\nWe rely upon a number of partners to make our service available on their devices.\n\nWe currently offer members the ability to receive streaming content through a host of internet-connected devices, including TVs, digital video players, TV set-top boxes and mobile devices. We have agreements with various cable, satellite and telecommunications operators to make our service available through the TV set-top boxes of these service providers, some of which compete directly with us or have investments in competing streaming content providers. In many instances, our agreements also include provisions by which the partner bills consumers directly for the Netflix service or otherwise offers services or products in connection with offering our service. If partners or other providers do a better job of connecting consumers with content they want to watch, for example through multi-service discovery interfaces, our service may be adversely impacted. We intend to continue to broaden our relationships with existing partners and to increase our capability to stream content and offer games to other platforms and partners over time. If we are not successful in maintaining existing and creating new relationships, or if we encounter technological, content licensing, regulatory, business or other impediments to delivering our streaming content to our members via these devices, our ability to retain members and grow our business could be adversely impacted.\n\nOur agreements with our partners are typically between one and three years in duration and our business could be adversely affected if, upon expiration, a number of our partners do not continue to provide access to our service or are unwilling to do so on terms acceptable to us, which terms may include the degree of accessibility and prominence of our service. Furthermore, devices are manufactured and sold by entities other than Netflix and while these entities should be responsible for the devices’ performance, the connection between these devices and our service may nonetheless result in consumer dissatisfaction toward us and such dissatisfaction could result in claims against us or otherwise adversely impact our business. In addition, technology changes to our streaming functionality may require that partners update their devices, and from time to time, lead to us to stop supporting the delivery of our service on certain legacy devices. If partners do not update or otherwise modify their devices, or if we discontinue support for certain devices, our service and our members' use and enjoyment could be negatively impacted.\n\nWe are subject to payment processing risk.\n\nOur members pay for our service using a variety of different payment methods, including credit and debit cards, gift cards, prepaid cards, direct debit, online wallets and direct carrier and partner billing. We rely on internal systems and those of third parties to process payment. Acceptance and processing of these payment methods are subject to certain rules, regulations, and industry standards, including data storage requirements, additional authentication requirements for certain payment methods, and require payment of interchange and other fees. To the extent there are increases in payment processing fees, material changes in the payment ecosystem, such as large re-issuances of payment cards, delays in receiving payments from payment processors, changes to rules, regulations or industry standards concerning payments, loss of payment partners and/or disruptions or failures in our payment processing systems, partner systems or payment products, including products we use to update payment information, our revenue, operating expenses and results of operations could be adversely impacted. In certain instances, we leverage third parties such as our cable and other partners to bill members on our behalf. If these third parties become unwilling or unable to continue processing payments on our behalf, we would have to transition members or otherwise find alternative methods of collecting payments, which could adversely impact member acquisition and retention. In addition, from time to time, we encounter fraudulent use of payment methods, which could impact our results of operations and if not adequately controlled and managed could create negative consumer perceptions of our service. If we are unable to maintain our fraud and chargeback rate at acceptable levels, card networks may\n\n6", "Table of Contents\n\nimpose fines, our card approval rate may be impacted and we may be subject to additional card authentication requirements. The termination of our ability to process payments on any major payment method would significantly impair our ability to operate our business.\n\nIf government regulations relating to the internet or other areas of our business change, we may need to alter the manner in which we conduct our business, or incur greater operating expenses.\n\nThe adoption or modification of laws or regulations relating to the internet or other areas of our business could limit or otherwise adversely affect the manner in which we currently conduct our business. As our service and others like us gain traction in international markets, governments are increasingly looking to introduce new or extend legacy regulations to these services, in particular those related to broadcast media and tax. For example, European law enables individual member states to impose levies and other financial obligations on media operators that provide services in their jurisdiction. Several European Union (EU) Member States have and others may, over time, impose financial and regulatory obligations on us. In addition, the continued growth and development of the market for online commerce may lead to more stringent consumer protection laws, which may impose additional burdens on us. Rules governing new technological developments, including generative artificial intelligence, are nascent and rapidly evolving such that the impact on areas related to our business remains uncertain. For example, in Europe, the Digital Markets Act remains subject to non-compliance investigations, the result of which could change how we interact with digital gatekeepers like Apple and Google. If we are required to comply with new regulations or legislation or new interpretations of existing regulations or legislation, this compliance could cause us to incur additional expenses or alter our business model.\n\nChanges in laws or regulations that adversely affect the growth, popularity or use of the internet, including laws impacting net neutrality, requiring payment of network access fees or payment of network support taxes, could decrease the demand for our service and increase our cost of doing business. Certain laws intended to prevent network operators from discriminating against the legal traffic that traverse their networks have been implemented in many countries, including across the EU and several U.S. states. In others, the laws may be nascent, evolving or non-existent. For example, a U.S. federal appeals court recently overturned the Federal Communications Commission's net neutrality rules. Given uncertainty around these rules, including changing interpretations, amendments or repeal, coupled with potentially significant political and economic power of local network operators, we could experience discriminatory or anti-competitive practices that could impede our growth, cause us to incur additional expense or otherwise negatively affect our business.\n\nWe are engaged in legal proceedings that could cause us to incur unforeseen expenses and could occupy a significant amount of our management's time and attention.\n\nFrom time to time, we are subject to litigation or claims that could negatively affect our business operations and financial position. As we have grown, we have seen a rise in the number of litigation matters against us. These matters have included copyright and other claims related to our content, products, patent infringement claims, tax litigation, employment related litigation, as well as consumer and securities class actions, each of which are typically expensive to defend. Litigation disputes could cause us to incur unforeseen expenses, result in content unavailability, service disruptions, and otherwise occupy a significant amount of our management's time and attention, any of which could negatively affect our business operations and financial position. We also receive inquiries and subpoenas and other types of information requests from government authorities, and we may become subject to related claims and other actions related to our business activities. While the ultimate outcome of investigations, inquiries, information requests and related legal proceedings is difficult to predict, such matters can be expensive, time-consuming and distracting, and adverse resolutions or settlements of those matters may result in, among other things, modification of our business practices, reputational harm or costs and significant payments, any of which could negatively affect our business operations and financial position.\n\nOur advertising offering is new and subject to various risks and uncertainties, which may adversely affect our business.\n\nWe have limited experience and operating history offering advertising on our service, and our advertising revenue may not grow as we expect. Our ability to generate advertising revenue is subject to various risks and will depend on a number of factors, including:\n\n•our ability to attract and retain advertisers;\n\n•fluctuations in memberships, including those selecting the ad-supported subscription plan, and member engagement;\n\n•the quantity or quality of ads shown to our members;\n\n•our ability to compete effectively for advertising spend;\n\n•the impact of seasonal, cyclical or other shifts in advertising spend, including the impact of macroeconomic conditions;\n\n•the availability, accuracy, utility, and security of analytics and measurement solutions offered by us or third parties that demonstrate the value of our ads to marketers, or our ability to further improve such tools;\n\n•changes in the way advertising on devices, connected TVs or on personal computers is measured or priced;\n\n•adverse legal developments relating to advertising or measurement tools;\n\n•changes in third-party policies, which may negatively impact the ability to measure, deliver and select ads to be served;\n\n•regulatory, legislative and industry developments relating to the collection and use of information and other privacy considerations, including regulations related to ad targeting and measurement tools;\n\n•any liability or reputational harm from advertisements shown on our service;\n\n7", 'Table of Contents\n\n•our relationship with third-party service providers for the management, operation, sale and technology to support advertisements on our service;\n\n•our ability to develop and expand an advertising sales and advertising technology organization team;\n\n•our ability to develop the technology and related infrastructure to support advertising and drive value to advertisers;\n\n•the impact of our content and reputation on advertisers’ willingness to spend with us; and\n\n•any member dissatisfaction due to advertisements.\n\nRisks Related to Intellectual Property\n\nIf studios, content providers or other rights holders refuse to license streaming content or other rights upon terms acceptable to us, our business could be adversely affected.\n\nOur ability to provide our members with content they can enjoy depends on obtaining various rights from third parties upon terms acceptable to us, including necessary distribution rights, to such content and certain related elements thereof, such as the public performance of music contained within the content we distribute. The license periods and the terms and conditions of such rights vary. As content providers develop their own streaming services, they may be unwilling to provide us with access to certain content, including popular series or movies. If the studios, content providers and other rights holders are not or are no longer willing or able to license us content upon terms acceptable to us, our ability to stream content to our members may be adversely affected and/or our costs could increase. Certain licenses for content provide for the studios or other content providers to withdraw content from our service relatively quickly. Because of these provisions and other actions we may take, content available through our service can be withdrawn on short notice. As competition increases, we see the cost of certain programming increase. As we seek to differentiate our service, we are often focused on securing certain exclusive rights when obtaining content, including original content. We are also focused on programming an overall mix of content that delights our members in a cost efficient manner. Within this context, we are selective about the titles we add and renew to our service. If we do not maintain a compelling mix of content, our member acquisition and retention may be adversely affected.\n\nMusic and certain authors’ performances contained within content we distribute may require us to obtain licenses for such distribution. In this regard, we engage in negotiations with collection management organizations (“CMOs”) and similar entities that hold certain rights to music and/or other interests in intellectual property (e.g., remuneration rights) in connection with streaming content into various territories. If we are unable to reach mutually acceptable terms with these organizations, we could become involved in litigation and/or could be enjoined from distributing certain content, which could adversely impact our business. Additionally, pending and ongoing litigation and negotiations between certain CMOs and other third parties in various territories could adversely impact our negotiations with CMOs, or result in music publishers represented by certain CMOs unilaterally withdrawing rights, and thereby adversely impact our ability to reach licensing agreements reasonably acceptable to us. Failure to reach such licensing agreements could expose us to potential liability for copyright infringement or otherwise increase our costs. Additionally, as the market for the digital distribution of content grows, a broader role for CMOs in the remuneration of authors, performers and other beneficiaries of neighboring rights is likely to expose us to greater distribution expenses in certain markets.\n\nIf our trademarks and other proprietary rights are not adequately protected to prevent use or appropriation by third parties, the value of our brand and other intangible assets may be diminished, and our business may be adversely affected.\n\nWe rely and expect to continue to rely on a combination of confidentiality and license agreements with our employees, consultants and third parties with whom we have relationships, as well as trademark, copyright, patent and trade secret protection laws, to protect our proprietary rights. We may also seek to enforce our proprietary rights through court proceedings or other legal actions. We have filed and we expect to file from time to time for trademark, copyright, and patent applications. Nevertheless, these applications may not be approved, third parties may challenge any copyrights, patents or trademarks issued to or held by us, third parties may knowingly or unknowingly infringe our intellectual property rights, and we may not be able to prevent infringement or misappropriation without substantial expense to us. If the protection of our intellectual property rights is inadequate to prevent use or misappropriation by third parties, the value of our brand, content, and other intangible assets may be diminished, competitors may be able to more effectively mimic our service and methods of operations, the perception of our business and service to members and potential members may become confused in the marketplace, and our ability to attract members may be adversely affected.\n\nWe currently hold various domain names relating to our brand, including Netflix.com. Failure to protect our domain names could adversely affect our reputation and brand and make it more difficult for users to find our website and our service. We may be unable, without significant cost or at all, to prevent third parties from acquiring domain names that are similar to, infringe upon or otherwise decrease the value of our trademarks and other proprietary rights.\n\nIntellectual property claims against us could be costly and result in the loss of significant rights related to, among other things, our technology, business processes, and content.\n\nTrademark, copyright, patent and other intellectual property rights are important to us and other companies. Our intellectual property rights extend to our technology, business processes, the content we produce and distribute through our service, and consumer products,\n\n8', 'Table of Contents\n\nexperiences, and marketing assets based thereon. We use the intellectual property of third parties in creating some of our content, merchandising our products and experiences, and marketing our service. From time to time, third parties allege that we have infringed or otherwise violated their intellectual property rights. If we are unable to obtain sufficient rights, successfully defend our use, or develop non-infringing technology or otherwise alter our business practices on a timely basis in response to claims against us for infringement, misappropriation, misuse or other violation of third-party intellectual property rights, our business and competitive position may be adversely affected. In addition, the use or adoption of new and emerging technologies may increase our exposure to intellectual property claims, and the availability of copyright and other intellectual property protection for AI-generated material is uncertain. Many companies are devoting significant resources to developing patents that could potentially affect many aspects of our business. There are numerous patents that broadly claim means and methods of conducting business on the internet. We have not searched for patents relative to our technology. Defending ourselves against intellectual property claims, whether they are with or without merit or are determined in our favor, results in costly litigation and diversion of technical and management personnel. It also may result in our inability to use our current technology and products, our recommendation and merchandising technology or inability to market our service or merchandise our products. We may also have to remove content from our service, or remove consumer products or marketing materials from the marketplace. As a result of a dispute, we may have to develop non-infringing technology, enter into royalty or licensing agreements, adjust our content, merchandising or marketing activities or take other actions to resolve the claims. These actions, if required, may be costly or unavailable on terms acceptable to us.\n\nRisks Related to Information Technology\n\nAny significant disruption in or unauthorized access to our computer systems or those of third parties that we utilize in our operations, including those relating to cybersecurity or arising from cyber-attacks, could result in a loss or degradation of service, unauthorized access, disclosure or destruction of data, including member and corporate information, or theft of intellectual property, including digital content assets, which could adversely impact our business.\n\nOur reputation and ability to attract, retain and serve our members is dependent upon the reliable performance and security of our computer systems and those of third parties that we utilize in our operations. These systems may be subject to damage or interruption from, among other things, earthquakes, adverse weather conditions, other natural disasters, public health issues such as pandemics or epidemics, terrorist attacks, rogue employees, power loss, telecommunications failures, cybersecurity risks and incidents, and other interruptions beyond our control. Interruptions in these systems, or with the internet in general, could make our service unavailable or degraded or otherwise hinder our ability to deliver our service. Service interruptions, errors in our software or the unavailability of computer systems or data used in our operations could diminish the overall attractiveness of our service to existing and potential members.\n\nOur computer systems and those of third parties we use in our operations are subject to constantly evolving cybersecurity threats, including cyber-attacks such as computer viruses, malware, ransomware, denial of service attacks, physical or electronic break-ins, or insider threats, as well as misconfigurations in information systems, networks, software or hardware, and similar disruptions or errors. These systems and those of third parties with which we do business have experienced and may continue to experience directed attacks intended to lead to interruptions and delays in our service and operations as well as loss, misuse or theft of personal information (of third parties, employees, and our members) and other data, confidential information or intellectual property. We and many of the third parties we work with rely on open source software and libraries that are integrated into a variety of applications, tools and systems, which may increase our exposure to vulnerabilities. The addition of new features or upgrades also increases our exposure to vulnerabilities, and generative artificial intelligence could intensify these cybersecurity risks. Additionally, outside parties may attempt to induce employees, vendors, partners, or users to disclose sensitive or confidential information in order to gain access to data. Any attempt by hackers to obtain our data (including member and corporate information) or intellectual property (including digital content assets), disrupt our service, or otherwise access our systems, or those of third parties we use, if successful, could harm our business, be expensive to remedy and damage our reputation. We have implemented certain systems and processes to thwart hackers and protect our data and systems. However, the techniques used to gain unauthorized access to data and software are constantly evolving, and we may be unable to anticipate, detect or prevent unauthorized access or address all cybersecurity incidents that occur. Because of our prominence, we (and/or third parties we use) have been and may continue to be a particularly attractive target for such attacks, and from time to time, we have experienced unauthorized releases of certain digital content assets and unintended disclosure of personal information due to incidents related to third parties. However, to date these unauthorized releases have not had a material impact on our service, systems or business. There is no assurance that hackers may not have a material impact on our service or systems in the future. We do not carry insurance to cover expenses related to such disruptions or unauthorized access. Efforts to prevent hackers from disrupting our service or otherwise accessing our systems are expensive to develop, implement and maintain. These efforts require ongoing monitoring and updating as technologies change and efforts to overcome security measures become more sophisticated, and may limit the functionality of or otherwise negatively impact our service offering and systems. Any significant disruption to our service or access to our systems could result in a loss of members, damage our reputation, and adversely affect our business and results of operations. Further, a penetration of our systems or a third-party’s systems or other misappropriation or misuse of personal information could subject us to business, regulatory, litigation and reputation risk, which could have a negative effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\nWe utilize our own communications and computer hardware systems located either in our facilities or in that of a third-party provider. In addition, we utilize third-party “cloud” computing services in connection with our business operations. We also utilize our own and third-party\n\n9', 'Table of Contents\n\ncontent delivery networks ("CDN") to help us stream content and offer games in high volume to Netflix members over the internet. Problems faced by us or our third-party “cloud” computing or other network providers, including technological or business-related disruptions, as well as cybersecurity threats and regulatory interference, could adversely impact the experience of our members.\n\nWe rely upon Amazon Web Services to operate certain aspects of our service and any disruption of or interference with our use of the Amazon Web Services operation would impact our operations and our business would be adversely impacted.\n\nAmazon Web Services (“AWS”) provides a distributed computing infrastructure platform for business operations, or what is commonly referred to as a "cloud" computing service. We have architected our software and computer systems so as to utilize data processing, storage capabilities and other services provided by AWS. Currently, we run the vast majority of our computing on AWS. Given this, along with the fact that we cannot easily switch our AWS operations to another cloud provider, any commercial disputes related to, disruption of or interference with our use of AWS would impact our operations and our business would be adversely impacted. While the retail side of Amazon competes with us, we do not believe that Amazon will use the AWS operation in such a manner as to gain competitive advantage against our service, although if it were to do so it could harm our business.\n\nIf the technology we use in operating our business fails, is unavailable, or does not operate to expectations, our business and results of operations could be adversely impacted.\n\nWe utilize a combination of proprietary and third-party technology to operate our business. This includes the technology that we have developed to recommend and merchandise content to our consumers as well as enable fast and efficient delivery of content to our members and their various consumer electronic devices. For example, we have built and deployed our own CDN. To the extent Internet Service Providers (“ISPs”) do not interconnect with our CDN or charge us to access their networks, or if we experience difficulties in our CDN’s operation, our ability to efficiently and effectively deliver our streaming content to our members could be adversely impacted and our business and results of operations could be adversely affected. Likewise, if our recommendation and merchandising technology does not enable us to predict and recommend titles that our members will enjoy, our ability to attract and retain members may be adversely affected. We also utilize third-party technology to help market our service, process payments, and otherwise manage the daily operations of our business. If our technology or that of third-parties we utilize in our operations fails or otherwise operates improperly, including as a result of “bugs” or other errors in our development and deployment of software, our ability to operate our service, retain existing members and add new members may be impaired. Any harm to our members’ devices caused by software used in our operations could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\n\nChanges in how network operators handle and charge for access to data that travel across their networks could adversely impact our business.\n\nWe rely upon the ability of consumers to access our service through the internet. If network operators block, restrict or otherwise impair access to our service over their networks, our service and business could be negatively affected. To the extent that network operators implement usage based pricing, including meaningful bandwidth caps, or otherwise try to monetize access to their networks by data providers, we could incur greater operating expenses and our member acquisition and retention could be negatively impacted. Furthermore, to the extent network operators create tiers of internet access service and either charge us for or prohibit us from being available through these tiers, our business could be negatively impacted.\n\nMost network operators that provide consumers with access to the internet also provide these consumers with multichannel video programming. As such, many network operators have an incentive to use their network infrastructure in a manner adverse to our continued growth and success. While we believe that consumer demand, regulatory oversight and competition will help counterbalance these incentives, to the extent that network operators are able to provide preferential treatment to their data as opposed to ours or otherwise implement discriminatory network management practices, our business could be negatively impacted. The extent to which these incentives limit operator behavior differs across markets.\n\nRisks Related to Privacy\n\nPrivacy concerns could limit our ability to collect and leverage member personal information and disclosure of member personal information could adversely impact our business and reputation.\n\nIn the ordinary course of business and in particular in connection with content acquisition, merchandising our service to our members and our advertising offering, we collect and utilize information supplied by our members and third parties, which may include personal information and other data. We are subject to laws, rules and regulations relating to privacy and the collection, use and security of personal information, including but not limited to Regulation (EU) 2016/679 (also known as the General Data Protection Regulation or “GDPR”) and the California Privacy Rights Act ("CPRA"). Any actual or perceived failure to comply with the GDPR, the California Consumer Privacy Act/CPRA, other data privacy laws or regulations, or related contractual or other obligations, or any perceived privacy rights violation, have and could in the future lead to investigations, claims, and proceedings by governmental entities and private parties, which to date have not been material but\n\n10', 'Table of Contents\n\nmay result in significant damages for contract breach, and other significant costs, penalties, and other liabilities, as well as harm to our reputation and market position.\n\nOther businesses have been criticized by privacy groups and governmental bodies for attempts to link personal identities and other information to data collected on the internet regarding users’ browsing and other habits. Increased regulation of data utilization practices, including self-regulation or findings under existing laws that limit our ability to collect, transfer and use personal information, could have an adverse effect on our business. In addition, if we were to disclose personal information about our members in a manner that was objectionable to them, our business reputation could be adversely affected, and we could face potential legal claims that could impact our operating results. Internationally, we may become subject to additional and/or more stringent legal obligations concerning our treatment of member and other personal information, such as laws regarding data localization, data transfer and/or restrictions on data export. Failure to comply with these obligations could subject us to liability, and to the extent that we need to alter our business model or practices to adapt to these obligations, we could incur additional expenses.\n\nOur reputation and relationships with members would be harmed if member personal information, particularly billing data, were to be accessed by unauthorized persons.\n\nWe maintain personal information regarding our members, including names, age, gender and billing information. This personal information is maintained on our own systems as well as that of third parties we use in our operations. With respect to billing information, such as credit card numbers, we rely on encryption and authentication technology to secure such information. We take measures to protect against unauthorized intrusion into our members’ information. Despite these measures and technologies we, our payment processing services or other third-party services we use such as AWS, could experience an unauthorized intrusion into our members’ information. In the event of such a breach, current and potential members may become unwilling to provide the information to us necessary for them to remain or become members. We have notified and may in the future be required to notify regulators about any actual or perceived data breach (including various state Attorneys General, one or more EU data protection authorities, or other data protection authorities) as well as the individuals who are affected by the incident within strict time periods. Additionally, we could face legal claims or regulatory fines or penalties for such a breach. The costs relating to any data breach could be material, and we currently do not carry insurance against the risk of a data breach. We also maintain personal information concerning our employees, as well as personal information of others working on our productions. Should an unauthorized intrusion into our members’ or employees’ personal information and/or production personal information occur, our business could be adversely affected and our larger reputation with respect to data protection could be negatively impacted.\n\nRisks Related to Liquidity\n\nThe long-term and largely fixed cost nature of our content commitments may limit our operating flexibility and could adversely affect our liquidity and results of operations.\n\nIn connection with licensing streaming content, we typically enter into multi-year commitments with studios and other content providers. We also enter into multi-year commitments for content that we produce, either directly or through third parties, including elements associated with these productions such as non-cancelable commitments under talent agreements. The payment terms of these agreements are not tied to member usage or the size of our membership base (“fixed cost”) but may be determined by costs of production or tied to such factors as titles licensed and/or theatrical exhibition receipts. Such commitments, to the extent estimable under accounting standards, are included in the Contractual Obligations section of Part II, Item 7, "Management\'s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" and Note 8, Commitments and Contingencies in the accompanying notes to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8, "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Given the multiple-year duration and largely fixed cost nature of content commitments, if business performance does not meet our expectations, our margins may be adversely impacted. Further, we may be unable to react to any reduction in our cash flows from operations, including those caused by a downturn in the economy, by reducing our streaming content obligations in the near-term. Payment terms for certain content commitments, such as content we directly produce, will typically require more up-front cash payments than other content licenses or arrangements whereby we do not fund the production of such content. To the extent revenue growth does not meet our expectations, our liquidity and results of operations could be adversely affected as a result of content commitments and accelerated payment requirements of certain agreements. In addition, the long-term and largely fixed cost nature of our content commitments may limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to changes in our business and the market segments in which we operate. If we license and/or produce content that is not favorably received by consumers in a territory, or is unable to be shown in a territory, acquisition and retention may be adversely impacted and given the long-term and fixed cost nature of our content commitments, we may not be able to adjust our content offerings quickly and our results of operations may be adversely impacted.\n\nWe may seek additional capital that may result in stockholder dilution or that may have rights senior to those of our common stockholders.\n\nFrom time to time, we may seek to obtain additional capital, either through equity, equity-linked or debt securities. The decision to obtain additional capital will depend on, among other things, our business plans, operating performance and condition of the capital markets. Rising interest rates or any disruption in the capital markets could make it more difficult and expensive for us to raise additional capital or refinance\n\n11', 'Table of Contents\n\nour existing indebtedness. If we raise additional funds through the issuance of equity, equity-linked or debt securities, those securities may have rights, preferences or privileges senior to the rights of our common stock, and our stockholders may experience dilution. Any large equity or equity-linked offering could also negatively impact our stock price.\n\nWe have a substantial amount of indebtedness and other obligations, including streaming content obligations, which could adversely affect our financial position, and we may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service our debt and other obligations.\n\nWe have a substantial amount of indebtedness and other obligations, including streaming content obligations. Moreover, we may incur additional indebtedness in the future and incur other obligations, including additional streaming content obligations. Our ability to make payments on our debt and other obligations will depend on our financial and operating performance, which is subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions and to certain financial, business and other factors beyond our control. If we are unable to service our debt and other obligations from cash flows, we may need to refinance or restructure all or a portion of such obligations prior to maturity. If the financial markets become difficult or costly to access, including due to rising interest rates, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates or other changes in economic conditions, our ability to raise additional capital may be negatively impacted, and any refinancing or restructuring could be at higher interest rates and may require us to comply with more onerous covenants, which could further restrict our business operations.\n\nAs of December\xa031, 2024, we had the equivalent of $15.7 billion aggregate principal amount of senior notes outstanding (“Notes”), some of which is denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. In addition, we have entered into a revolving credit agreement that provides for a $3 billion unsecured revolving credit facility. As of December\xa031, 2024, we have not borrowed any amount under this revolving credit facility. As of December\xa031, 2024, we had approximately $6.2 billion of total content liabilities as reflected on our consolidated balance sheet, some of which is denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Such amount does not include streaming content commitments that do not meet the criteria for liability recognition, the amounts of which are significant. Our substantial indebtedness and other obligations, including streaming content obligations, may require us to use a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to make debt service payments and pay our other obligations when due, limit our ability to borrow additional funds, limit our flexibility to plan for, or react to, changes in our business and industry and place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our less leveraged competitors. For more information on our streaming content obligations, including those not on our consolidated balance sheet, see Note 8, Commitments and Contingencies, in the accompanying notes to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8, "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n\nRisks Related to International Operations\n\nWe could be subject to economic, political, regulatory and other risks arising from our international operations.\n\nOperating in international markets requires significant resources and management attention and will subject us to economic, political, regulatory and other risks that may be different from or incremental to those in the U.S. In addition to the risks that we face in the U.S., our international operations involve risks that could adversely affect our business, including:\n\n•the need to adapt our content and user interfaces for specific cultural and language differences;\n\n•difficulties and costs associated with staffing and managing foreign operations;\n\n•political or social unrest, global hostilities, and economic instability;\n\n•compliance with laws such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, UK Bribery Act and other anti-corruption laws, export controls and economic sanctions, and local laws prohibiting corrupt payments to government officials;\n\n•difficulties in understanding and complying with local laws, regulations and customs in foreign jurisdictions;\n\n•regulatory requirements or government action, whether in response to enforcement of actual or purported legal and regulatory requirements or otherwise, that results in disruption or non-availability of our service or particular content, administrative enforcement actions, fines, and civil and criminal liability, or increased operating costs in the applicable jurisdiction;\n\n•application of foreign intellectual property laws, which requires the business to adapt to bespoke compliance rules, or changes to such laws, among other issues, may impact the economics of creating or distributing content, anti-piracy efforts, or our ability to protect or exploit intellectual property rights;\n\n•adverse tax consequences such as those related to changes in tax laws or tax rates or their interpretations, and the related application of judgment in determining our global provision for income taxes, deferred tax assets or liabilities or other tax liabilities given the ultimate tax determination is uncertain;\n\n•fluctuations in currency exchange rates, which have and may continue to impact revenues and expenses of our international operations and expose us to foreign currency exchange rate risk, and while we use derivative and non-derivative instruments to hedge certain exposures to fluctuations in exchange rates, the use of such hedging activities may not be effective in offsetting an adverse financial impact and may introduce or heighten counterparty risk and we may choose not to hedge certain exposures;\n\n•rates of inflation;\n\n•profit repatriation, currency control regulations and other restrictions on the transfer of funds;\n\n•differing payment processing systems as well as consumer use and acceptance of electronic payment methods, such as payment cards;\n\n•new and different sources of competition;\n\n12', 'Table of Contents\n\n•censorship requirements that cause us to remove or edit popular content, leading to consumer disappointment, brand tarnishment or dissatisfaction with our service;\n\n•low usage and/or penetration of internet-connected consumer electronic devices;\n\n•different and more stringent user protection, data protection, privacy and other laws, including data localization and/or restrictions on data export, and local ownership requirements;\n\n•availability of reliable broadband connectivity and wide area networks in targeted areas for expansion;\n\n•differing laws and consumer understanding/attitudes regarding the illegality of piracy;\n\n•negative impacts from trade disputes; and\n\n•implementation of regulations designed to stimulate the local production of film and TV series in order to promote and preserve local culture and economic activity, including local content quotas, investment obligations, and levies to support local film funds. For example, the EU revised its Audio Visual Media Services Directive in 2018 to require that European works comprise at least thirty percent (30%) of media service providers’ catalogs, and to require prominence of those works, and certain EU Member States have imposed additional investment obligations and levies.\n\nThese and other factors may cause us to adjust our business plans, including expanding or ceasing certain operations in certain countries, and the execution of our strategies. Our failure to manage any of these risks successfully could harm our international operations and our overall business, and results of our operations.\n\nWe are subject to taxation related risks in multiple jurisdictions.\n\nWe are a U.S.-based multinational company subject to tax in multiple U.S. and foreign tax jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in determining our global provision for income taxes, deferred taxes and other tax liabilities and receivables, and in evaluating our tax positions and other tax attributes on a worldwide basis. We are subject to the periodic examination of our domestic and foreign tax returns by the Internal Revenue Service, state, local, and foreign tax authorities, some of whom are challenging our tax positions. We regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes from these examinations in determining the adequacy of our provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities. We consider many factors when evaluating and estimating our tax positions and tax benefits, which may require periodic adjustments and may not accurately forecast actual tax audit outcomes. If the ultimate determination of income and other tax liabilities differ from the amounts recorded or accrued, our business, financial condition or results of operations may be adversely impacted.\n\nTax laws are regularly being re-examined and evaluated globally. New laws and interpretations of the law are taken into account for financial statement purposes in the quarter or year that they become applicable. Tax authorities are increasingly scrutinizing the tax positions of companies and we have tax audits pending in several jurisdictions. The U.S. federal and state governments, countries in the EU, as well as a number of other countries and organizations such as the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, are actively considering changes to existing tax laws that, if enacted, could increase our tax obligations in jurisdictions where we do business. If U.S. or other tax authorities change applicable tax laws or successfully challenge how or where our profits are currently recognized, our overall taxes could increase, and our business, financial condition or results of operations may be adversely impacted.\n\nRisks Related to Human Resources\n\nWe may lose key employees or may be unable to hire qualified employees, and the failure to maintain and improve our company culture may adversely affect our business.\n\nWe rely on the continued service of our senior management, including our Co-Chief Executive Officers, Ted Sarandos and Greg Peters, members of our executive team and other key employees. In our industry, there is substantial and continuous competition for highly-skilled business, product development, technical, creative and other personnel. If we experience high executive turnover, fail to adapt our business practices to industry expectations, fail to maintain a positive reputation, fail to implement succession plans for key employees, encounter difficulties associated with the transition of members of our management team, are not successful in recruiting new personnel or in retaining and motivating existing personnel, in instilling our culture in new employees, or maintaining and improving our culture as we grow, our operations may be disrupted, which could adversely affect our results of operations.\n\nLabor disputes may have an adverse effect on the Company’s business.\n\nWe and our partners, suppliers, and vendors engage writers, directors, actors, other talent, trade employees and others who are subject to collective bargaining agreements in the motion picture industry, both in the U.S. and internationally. Expiring collective bargaining agreements may be renewed on terms that are unfavorable to us. If expiring collective bargaining agreements cannot be renewed, affected unions have, and could in the future, take action in the form of strikes or work stoppages. Such work stoppages have resulted, and may in the future result, in halted productions and delays in our ability to provide new content to our members. Such actions, as well as higher costs or operating complexities in connection with these collective bargaining agreements or a significant labor dispute, could have an adverse effect on our business by causing delays in production, added costs or by reducing profit margins, and our ability to provide new content to our members could likewise be delayed or dropped.\n\n13', 'Table of Contents\n\nRisks Related to Our Stock Ownership\n\nProvisions in our charter documents and under Delaware law could discourage a takeover that stockholders may consider favorable, although we have announced plans to modify some of these provisions over time.\n\nOur charter documents in their current form may discourage, delay or prevent a merger or acquisition that a stockholder may consider favorable because they:\n\n•authorize our board of directors, without stockholder approval, to issue up to 10,000,000 shares of undesignated preferred stock;\n\n•provide for a classified board of directors until our annual meeting of stockholders to be held in 2025;\n\n•prohibit our stockholders from acting by written consent; and\n\n•establish advance notice requirements for proposing matters to be approved by stockholders at stockholder meetings.\n\nAs a Delaware corporation, we are also subject to certain Delaware anti-takeover provisions. Under Delaware law, a corporation may not engage in a business combination with any holder of 15% or more of its capital stock unless the holder has held the stock for three years or, among other things, the board of directors has approved the transaction. Our board of directors could rely on Delaware law to prevent or delay an acquisition of us.\n\nIn addition, a merger or acquisition may trigger retention payments to certain executive employees under the terms of our Amended and Restated Executive Severance and Retention Incentive Plan, thereby increasing the cost of such a transaction.\n\nOur stock price is volatile.\n\nThe price at which our common stock has traded has fluctuated significantly. The price may continue to be volatile due to a number of factors including the following, some of which are beyond our control:\n\n•variations in our operating results, including our membership acquisition and retention, revenues, operating income, net income, net cash provided by operating activities and free cash flow;\n\n•variations between our actual operating results and the expectations of securities analysts, investors and the financial community;\n\n•announcements of developments affecting our business, systems or expansion plans by us or others;\n\n•competition, including the introduction of new competitors, their pricing strategies and services;\n\n•market volatility in general;\n\n•the level of demand for our stock, including the amount of short interest in our stock;\n\n•the impact of our current stock repurchase program and any future stock repurchase program we may adopt;\n\n•the operating results of our competitors; and\n\n•other risks and uncertainties described in these risk factors.\n\nAs a result of these and other factors, investors in our common stock may not be able to resell their shares at or above their original purchase price.\n\nFollowing certain periods of volatility in the market price of our securities, we became the subject of securities litigation. We may experience more such litigation following future periods of volatility. This type of litigation may result in substantial costs and a diversion of management’s attention and resources.\n\nPreparing and forecasting our financial results requires us to make judgments and estimates which may differ materially from actual results.\n\nGiven the dynamic nature of our business, and the inherent limitations in predicting the future, forecasts of our revenues, operating margins, net income and other financial and operating data may differ materially from actual results. Also, predicting consumer adoption of various pricing strategies, such as the ad-supported subscription plan or efforts to limit multi-household usage, and new revenue streams, such as advertising revenue, is inherently difficult given the lack of operating history with respect to such offerings, and actual results may differ significantly from the expectations of our management, securities analysts or investors. Such discrepancies could cause a decline in the trading price of our common stock. In addition, the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America also requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported periods. We base such estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, but actual results may differ from these estimates. For example, we estimate the content amortization pattern, beginning with the month of first availability, of any particular licensed or produced television series, documentary or feature film based upon various factors including historical and estimated viewing patterns. If actual viewing patterns differ from these estimates, the\n\n14', 'Table of Contents\n\npattern and/or period of amortization would be changed and could affect the timing or recognition of content amortization. If we revise such estimates it could result in greater in-period expenses, which could cause us to miss our earnings guidance or negatively impact the results we report which could negatively impact our stock price. Further, events outside of our control may cause actual results to differ from our forecast.\n\nItem 1B.Unresolved Staff Comments\n\nNone.\n\nItem 1C.Cybersecurity\n\nWe have an enterprise-wide information security program designed to identify, protect, detect and respond to and manage reasonably foreseeable cybersecurity risks and threats. To protect our information systems from cybersecurity threats, we use various security tools that help prevent, identify, escalate, investigate, resolve and recover from identified vulnerabilities and security incidents in a timely manner. These include, but are not limited to, internal reporting, monitoring and detection tools, and a bug bounty program to allow security researchers to assist us in identifying vulnerabilities in our products before they are exploited by malicious threat actors. We also maintain a third party security program to identify, prioritize, assess, mitigate and remediate third party risks; however, we rely on the third parties we use to implement security programs commensurate with their risk, and we cannot ensure in all circumstances that their efforts will be successful.\n\nWe regularly assess risks from cybersecurity and technology threats and monitor our information systems for potential vulnerabilities. We use a widely-adopted risk quantification model to identify, measure and prioritize cybersecurity and technology risks and develop related security controls and safeguards. We conduct regular reviews and tests of our information security program and also leverage audits by our internal audit team, tabletop exercises, penetration and vulnerability testing, red team exercises, simulations, and other exercises to evaluate the effectiveness of our information security program and improve our security measures and planning. We also engage an external auditor to conduct an annual payment card industry data security standard review of our security controls protecting payment information, as well as third-party penetration testing of our cardholder environment and related systems. The results of these assessments are reported to the Audit Committee.\n\nOur systems and those of third parties with which we do business have experienced and may continue to experience directed attacks intended to lead to interruptions and delays in our service and operations as well as loss, misuse or theft of personal information (of third parties, employees, and our members) and other data, confidential information or intellectual property, and we have experienced unauthorized releases of certain digital content assets and unintended disclosure of personal information due to incidents related to third parties. However, to date these incidents have not had a material impact on our service, systems or business. Any significant disruption to our service or access to our systems could result in a loss of members and adversely affect our business and results of operation. Further, a penetration of our systems or a third-party’s systems or other misappropriation or misuse of personal information could subject us to business, regulatory, litigation and reputation risk, which could have a negative effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. See "Risk Factors - Any significant disruption in or unauthorized access to our computer systems or those of third parties that we utilize in our operations, including those relating to cybersecurity or arising from cyber-attacks, could result in a loss or degradation of service, unauthorized access, disclosure or destruction of data, including member and corporate information, or theft of intellectual property, including digital content assets, which could adversely impact our business."\n\nThe Vice President of Security and Privacy Engineering leads our global information security organization responsible for overseeing the Netflix information security program. Our VP of Security and Privacy Engineering has over 30 years of industry experience, including serving in similar roles leading and overseeing cybersecurity programs at other public companies. Team members who support our information security program have relevant educational and industry experience, including holding similar positions at large technology companies. The teams provide regular reports to senior management and other relevant teams on various cybersecurity threats, assessments and findings.\n\nThe Board oversees our annual enterprise risk assessment, where we assess key risks within the company, including security and technology risks and cybersecurity threats. The Audit Committee of the Board oversees our cybersecurity risk and receives regular reports from our VP of Security and Privacy Engineering on various cybersecurity matters, including risk assessments, mitigation strategies, areas of emerging risks, incidents and industry trends, and other areas of importance.\n\n15', 'Table of Contents\n\nItem 2.Properties\n\nWe have leased principal properties in both Los Gatos, California, which is the location of our corporate headquarters, and in Los Angeles, California.

The discontinuance of our DVD business had an immaterial impact on our operations and financial results.\n\n(2) A paid membership (also referred to as a paid subscription) is defined as a membership that has the right to receive Netflix service following sign-up and a method of payment being provided, and that is not part of a free trial or certain other promotions that may be offered by the Company to new or rejoining members. Certain members have the option to add extra member sub accounts. These extra member sub accounts are not included in paid memberships. A membership is canceled and ceases to be reflected in the above metrics as of the effective cancellation date. Voluntary cancellations generally become effective at the end of the prepaid membership period. Involuntary cancellations, as a result of a failed method of payment, become effective immediately. Memberships are assigned to territories based on the geographic location used at time of sign-up as determined by the Company’s internal systems, which utilize industry standard geo-location technology.\n\n(3) We believe the non-GAAP financial measure of constant currency revenue is useful in analyzing the underlying trends in average monthly revenue per paying membership (“ARM”) absent foreign currency fluctuations. However, this non-GAAP financial measure should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, or superior to other financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP.\n\nIn order to exclude the effect of foreign currency rate fluctuations on ARM, we calculate current period revenue assuming foreign exchange rates had remained constant with foreign exchange rates from each of the corresponding months of the prior-year period and exclude the impact of hedging gains or losses realized as revenues. Constant currency percentage change in ARM is calculated as the percentage change between current period constant currency ARM and the prior comparative period ARM. The impact of hedging gains or losses is excluded from both the current and prior periods. For the year ended December\xa031, 2024, our revenues would have been approximately $1,424\xa0million higher, excluding the impact of hedging and had foreign currency exchange rates remained constant with those for the year ended December\xa031, 2023. The unfavorable foreign exchange rate impacts in the year ended December\xa031, 2024 were primarily driven by the devaluation of the Argentine peso relative to the U.S. dollar coupled with significant price increases in the local currency in this jurisdiction.\n\nOperating margin for the year ended December\xa031, 2024 increased six percentage points as compared to the prior comparative period, primarily due to revenues growing at a faster rate as compared to the growth in cost of revenues, sales and marketing, and technology and development expenses, coupled with lower general and administrative expenses.\n\n19', 'Table of Contents\n\nStreaming Revenues\n\nWe primarily derive revenues from monthly membership fees for services related to streaming content to our members. We offer a variety of streaming membership plans, the price of which varies by country and the features of the plan. As of December 31, 2024, pricing on our paid plans ranged from the U.S. dollar equivalent of $1 to $32 per month, and pricing on our extra member sub accounts ranged from the U.S. dollar equivalent of $2 to $8 per month. We expect that from time to time the prices of our membership plans in each country may change and we may test other plan and price variations.\n\nWe also earn revenue from advertisements presented on our streaming service, consumer products, live events and various other sources. Revenues earned from sources other than monthly membership fees were not a material component of streaming revenues for the years ended December\xa031, 2024, 2023, and 2022.\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|  | | |  | | | Year Ended December 31, | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |  | | | Change | | | | | | | | |\n|  | | |  | | | 2024 | | |  | | | 2023 | | |  | | | 2022 | | |  | | | 2024 vs. 2023 | | | | | | | | |\n|  | | |  | | | (in\xa0thousands,\xa0except\xa0percentages) | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |\n| Streaming revenues | | |  | | | $ | 39,000,966 |  |  | | | $ | 33,640,458 |  |  | | | $ | 31,469,852 |  |  | | | $ | 5,360,508 |  |  | | | 16 | | % |\n|  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |\n|  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |\n\nStreaming revenues for the year ended December\xa031, 2024 increased 16% as compared to the year ended December\xa031, 2023, primarily due to the growth in average paying memberships and price increases, partially offset by unfavorable changes in foreign exchange rates.\n\nThe following tables summarize streaming revenues and other streaming membership information by region for the years ended December\xa031, 2024, 2023 and 2022.

In the year ended December\xa031, 2024, the foreign exchange losses were primarily driven by the remeasurement of cash and content liability positions in currencies other than the functional currencies, partially offset by a non-cash gain of $122 million, net of hedging impacts, from the remeasurement of our €5,170 million Senior Notes. The foreign exchange loss in the year ended December\xa031, 2023 was primarily driven by a non-cash loss of $176\xa0million from the remeasurement of our Senior Notes denominated in euros, coupled with the remeasurement of cash and content liability positions in currencies other than the functional currencies.\n\nProvision for Income Taxes\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|  | | |  | | | Year Ended December\xa031, | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |  | | | Change | | | | | | | | |\n|  | | |  | | | 2024 | | |  | | | 2023 | | |  | | | 2022 | | |  | | | 2024 vs. 2023 | | | | | | | | |\n|  | | |  | | | (in thousands, except percentages) | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |\n| Provision for income taxes | | |  | | | $ | 1,254,026 |  |  | | | $ | 797,415 |  |  | | | $ | 772,005 |  |  | | | $ | 456,611 |  |  | | | 57 | | % |\n| Effective tax rate | | |  | | | 13 | | % |  | | | 13 | | % |  | | | 15 | | % |  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |\n\nThe effective tax rate for the year ended December\xa031, 2024 remained relatively flat as compared to the year ended December\xa031, 2023.

The amount of principal and interest due in the next twelve months is $2,487\xa0million. As of\xa0December\xa031, 2024, no amounts had been borrowed under our $3\xa0billion Revolving Credit Agreement. See Note 6 Debt in the accompanying notes to our consolidated financial statements.\n\nWe anticipate that we may periodically raise additional debt capital. Our ability to obtain this or any additional financing that we may choose or need, including for the refinancing of upcoming maturities or potential strategic acquisitions and investments, will depend on, among other things, our development efforts, business plans, operating performance, and the condition of the capital markets at the time we seek financing. We may not be able to obtain such financing on terms acceptable to us or at all. If we raise additional funds through the issuance of equity or debt securities, those securities may have rights, preferences or privileges senior to the rights of our common stock, and our stockholders may experience dilution.\n\nIn September 2023, the Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $10\xa0billion of our common stock, with no expiration date, and in December 2024, the Board of Directors increased the share repurchase authorization by an additional $15\xa0billion, also with no expiration date. Stock repurchases may be effected through open market repurchases in compliance with Rule 10b-18 under the Exchange Act, including through the use of trading plans intended to qualify under Rule 10b5-1 under the Exchange Act, privately-negotiated transactions, accelerated stock repurchase plans, block purchases, or other similar purchase techniques and in such amounts as management deems appropriate. We are not obligated to repurchase any specific number of shares, and the timing and actual number of shares repurchased will depend on a variety of factors, including our stock price, general economic, business and market conditions, and alternative investment opportunities. We may discontinue any repurchases of our common stock at any time without prior notice. In the fiscal year ended December\xa031, 2024, the Company repurchased 9,861,935 shares of common stock for an aggregate amount of $6,211\xa0million (excluding the 1% excise tax on stock repurchases as a result of the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022). As of December\xa031, 2024, $17.1\xa0billion remains available for repurchases.\n\nOur primary uses of cash include the acquisition, licensing and production of content, marketing programs, streaming delivery and personnel-related costs, as well as strategic acquisitions and investments. Cash payment terms for non-original content have historically been in line with the amortization period. Investments in original content, and in particular content that we produce and own, require more cash upfront relative to licensed content. For example, production costs are paid as the content is created, well in advance of when the content is available on the service and amortized. We expect to continue to significantly invest in global content, particularly in original content, which will impact our liquidity. We currently anticipate that cash flows from operations, available funds and access to financing sources, including our revolving credit facility, will continue to be sufficient to meet our cash needs for the next twelve months and beyond.\n\nOur material cash requirements from known contractual and other obligations primarily relate to our content, debt and lease obligations. As of December 31, 2024, the expected timing of those payments are as follows:\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| Contractual obligations (in thousands): | | |  | | | Total | | |  | | | Next 12 Months | | |  | | | Beyond 12 Months | | |\n| Content\xa0obligations\xa0(1) | | |  | | | $ | 23,248,931 |  |  | | | $ | 11,424,696 |  |  | | | $ | 11,824,235 |  |\n| Debt (2) | | |  | | | 19,841,462 | |  |  | | | 2,486,945 | |  |  | | | 17,354,517 | |  |\n| Operating lease obligations (3) | | |  | | | 2,761,120 | |  |  | | | 514,625 | |  |  | | | 2,246,495 | |  |\n| Total | | |  | | | $ | 45,851,513 |  |  | | | $ | 14,426,266 |  |  | | | $ | 31,425,247 |  |\n\n(1)As of December\xa031, 2024, content obligations were comprised of $4.4 billion included in "Current content liabilities" and $1.8 billion of "Non-current content liabilities" on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and $17.0 billion of obligations that are not reflected on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as they did not then meet the criteria for recognition.\n\nContent obligations include amounts related to the acquisition, licensing and production of content. An obligation for the production of content includes non-cancelable commitments under creative talent and employment agreements and other production related\n\n24', 'Table of Contents\n\ncommitments. An obligation for the acquisition and licensing of content is incurred at the time we enter into an agreement to obtain future titles. Once a title becomes available, a content liability is recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Certain agreements include the obligation to license rights for unknown future titles, the ultimate quantity and/or fees for which are not yet determinable as of the reporting date. Traditional film output deals, or certain TV series license agreements where the number of seasons to be aired is unknown, are examples of these types of agreements. The contractual obligations table above does not include any estimated obligation for the unknown future titles, payment for which could range from less than one year to more than five years. However, these unknown obligations are expected to be significant and we believe could include approximately $1 billion to $4 billion over the next three years, with the payments for the vast majority of such amounts expected to occur after the next twelve months. The foregoing range is based on considerable management judgments and the actual amounts may differ. Once we know the title that we will receive and the license fees, we include the amount in the contractual obligations table above.\n\n(2)Debt obligations include our Notes consisting of principal and interest payments. See Note 6 Debt in the accompanying notes to our consolidated financial statements for further details.\n\n(3)Operating lease obligations are comprised of operating lease liabilities included in "Accrued expenses and other liabilities" and "Other non-current liabilities" on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, inclusive of imputed interest. Operating lease obligations also include additional obligations that are not reflected on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as they did not meet the criteria for recognition. As of December\xa031, 2024, the Company has additional operating leases for real estate that have not yet commenced of $38\xa0million which has been included above. See Note 5 Balance Sheet Components in the accompanying notes to our consolidated financial statements for further details regarding leases.\n\nAs of December\xa031, 2024, we had gross unrecognized tax benefits of $432 million, of which $302 million was classified in “Other non-current liabilities" in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. At this time, an estimate of the range of reasonably possible adjustments to the balance of unrecognized tax benefits cannot be made. In addition, we may be required to pay deposits of approximately $800\xa0million related to certain direct and indirect taxes in the next twelve months, which are in excess of our typical annual obligations.\n\nCash Flows\n\nThe following table summarizes our cash flows:\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|  | | | Year Ended December\xa031, | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |  | | | Change | | | | | |\n|  | | | 2024 | | |  | | | 2023 | | |  | | | 2022 | | |  | | | 2024 vs. 2023 | | | | | |\n|  | | | (in thousands) | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |\n| Net cash provided by operating activities | | | $ | 7,361,364 |  |  | | | $ | 7,274,301 |  |  | | | $ | 2,026,257 |  |  | | | $ | 87,063 |  | 1 | | % |\n| Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities | | | (2,181,784) | |  |  | | | 541,751 | |  |  | | | (2,076,392) | |  |  | | | (2,723,535) | |  | (503) | | % |\n| Net cash used in financing activities | | | (4,074,427) | |  |  | | | (5,950,803) | |  |  | | | (664,254) | |  |  | | | (1,876,376) | |  | (32) | | % |\n\nNet cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December\xa031, 2024 increased $87 million as compared to the year ended December\xa031, 2023, primarily driven by a $3,304 million or 61% increase in net income, an increase in adjustments for non-cash expenses, and favorable changes in working capital, partially offset by an increase in payments for content assets. The payments for content assets increased $3,862 million, from $13,140 million to $17,003 million, or 29%.\n\nNet cash provided by (used in) investing activities for the year ended December\xa031, 2024 decreased $2,724 million as compared to the year ended December\xa031, 2023, primarily due to there being no maturities of investments in the year ended December\xa031, 2024, as compared to maturities of investments of $1,395 million in the year ended December\xa031, 2023, coupled with an increase in purchases of investments of $1,237\xa0million and an increase in purchases of property and equipment of $91\xa0million.\n\nNet cash used in financing activities for the year ended December\xa031, 2024 decreased $1,876 million as compared to the year ended December\xa031, 2023, primarily due to proceeds from the issuance of debt of $1,794\xa0million in the year ended December\xa031, 2024 and a $663\xa0million increase in the proceeds from the issuance of common stock. These cash inflows were partially offset by the repayment upon maturity of the $400\xa0million aggregate principal amount of our 5.750% Senior Notes in the year ended December\xa031, 2024 as compared to no repayments of debt in the corresponding period in 2023, coupled with a $218\xa0million increase in the repurchases of common stock.\n\nIndemnifications\n\nThe information set forth under Note 8 Commitments and Contingencies in the accompanying notes to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8, "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K is incorporated herein by reference.\n\n25', 'Table of Contents\n\nCritical Accounting Estimates\n\nThe preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported periods. The Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") has defined a company’s critical accounting policies as the ones that are most important to the portrayal of a company’s financial condition and results of operations, and which require a company to make its most difficult and subjective judgments. Based on this definition, we have identified the critical accounting policies and judgments addressed below. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates.\n\nContent\n\nWe acquire, license and produce content, including original programming, in order to offer our members unlimited viewing of video entertainment. The content licenses are for a fixed fee and specific windows of availability. Payment terms for certain content licenses and the production of content require more upfront cash payments relative to the amortization expense. Payments for content, including additions to content assets and the changes in related liabilities, are classified within "Net cash provided by operating activities" on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.\n\nWe recognize content assets (licensed and produced) as "Content assets, net" on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. For licensed content, we capitalize the fee per title and record a corresponding liability at the gross amount of the liability when the license period begins, the cost of the title is known and the title is accepted and available for streaming. For produced content, we capitalize costs associated with the production, including development costs, direct costs and production overhead.\n\nBased on factors including historical and estimated viewing patterns, we amortize the content assets (licensed and produced) in “Cost of revenues” on the Consolidated Statements of Operations over the shorter of each title\'s contractual window of availability or estimated period of use or ten years, beginning with the month of first availability. The amortization is on an accelerated basis, as we typically expect more upfront viewing, and film amortization is more accelerated than TV series amortization. On average, over 90% of a licensed or produced content asset is expected to be amortized within four years after its month of first availability. We review factors that impact the amortization of the content assets on a regular basis. Our estimates related to these factors require considerable management judgment.\n\nIn the normal course of business, we, or a third-party producing content on our behalf, may qualify for tax incentives through eligible spend on productions. The accounting for tax incentives is dependent on the particular type of incentive, including the nature of the benefit and the location the incentive is earned. In general, tax incentives are realized as cash receipts and may be received prior to or after a title launches on our service. Upon a title’s launch, any amounts we are eligible for through qualified production spend but have not received, are recognized in “Other current assets” or “Other non-current assets” on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as receivables. Tax incentives are generally accounted for as a reduction to the cost basis of content assets (presented in “Content assets, net”) and reduce content amortization over the life of the title (as presented in “Cost of revenues”) on the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\n\nOur business model is subscription based as opposed to a model generating revenues at a specific title level. Content assets (licensed and produced) are predominantly monetized as a group and therefore are reviewed at a group level when an event or change in circumstances indicates a change in the expected usefulness of the content or that the fair value may be less than unamortized cost. To date, we have not identified any such event or changes in circumstances. If such changes are identified in the future, these aggregated content assets will be stated at the lower of unamortized cost or fair value. In addition, unamortized costs for assets that have been, or are expected to be, abandoned are written off.\n\nIncome Taxes\n\nWe record a provision for income taxes for the anticipated tax consequences of our reported results of operations using the asset and liability method. Deferred income taxes are recognized by applying enacted statutory tax rates applicable to future years to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases as well as net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. The measurement of deferred tax assets is reduced, if necessary, by a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not they will not be realized.\n\nAlthough we believe our assumptions, judgments and estimates are reasonable, changes in tax laws or our interpretation of tax laws and the resolution of any tax audits could significantly impact the amounts provided for income taxes in our consolidated financial statements.\n\nIn evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets, in full or in part, we consider all available positive and negative evidence, including our past operating results, our forecast of future earnings and future taxable income, and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies. The assumptions utilized in determining future taxable income require significant judgment and are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying business. Actual operating results in future years could differ from our current assumptions, judgments and estimates.\n\n26', 'Table of Contents\n\nWe do not recognize certain tax benefits from uncertain tax positions within the provision for income taxes. We may recognize a tax benefit only if it is more likely than not the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such positions are then measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon settlement. Due to uncertainties in any tax audit outcome, our estimates of the ultimate settlement of our unrecognized tax positions may change and the actual tax benefits may differ significantly from the estimates.\n\nSee Note 10 Income Taxes to the consolidated financial statements for further information regarding income taxes.\n\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\n\nThe information set forth under Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements under the caption “Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” is incorporated herein by reference.\n\nItem 7A.Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk\n\nWe are exposed to market risks related to interest rate changes and the corresponding changes in the market values of our debt and foreign currency fluctuations.\n\nInterest Rate Risk\n\nAt December\xa031, 2024, our cash equivalents were generally invested in money market funds and time deposits. Interest paid on such funds fluctuates with the prevailing interest rate. Our short-term investments are primarily comprised of investments in government securities. These securities are classified as available-for-sale and are recorded at fair value with unrealized gains and losses, net of tax, included in accumulated other comprehensive income (“AOCI”) within Stockholders\' equity in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Changes in interest rates could adversely affect the market value of these securities.\n\nAs of December\xa031, 2024, we had $15.7 billion of debt, consisting of fixed rate unsecured debt in fifteen tranches due between 2025 and 2054. Refer to Note 6 Debt to the consolidated financial statements for details about all issuances. The fair value of our debt will fluctuate with movements of interest rates, increasing in periods of declining rates of interest and declining in periods of increasing rates of interest. The fair value of our debt will also fluctuate based on changes in foreign currency rates, as discussed below.\n\nForeign Currency Risk\n\nWe operate our business globally and transact in multiple currencies. Currencies denominated in other than the U.S. dollar accounted for 56% of revenue and 29% of operating expenses for the year ended December\xa031, 2024. We therefore have foreign currency risk related to these currencies, which are primarily the euro, the British pound, the Brazilian real, Argentine peso, and the Mexican peso.\n\nAccordingly, volatility in exchange rates, and in particular a weakening of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar may negatively affect our revenue and operating income as expressed in U.S. dollars. Excluding the impact of hedging gains or losses realized as revenues, our revenues for the year ended December\xa031, 2024 would have been approximately $1,424 million higher had foreign currency exchange rates remained constant with those in the same period of 2023. The unfavorable foreign exchange rate impact in the year ended December\xa031, 2024 was primarily driven by the devaluation of the Argentine peso relative to the U.S. dollar coupled with significant price increases in the local currency in this jurisdiction. See Part II, Item 7, "Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" for further information regarding our non-GAAP financial measure of constant currency.\n\nWe enter into foreign exchange forward contracts to mitigate fluctuations in forecasted U.S. dollar-equivalent revenues from changes in foreign currency exchange rates. These contracts may reduce, but do not entirely eliminate, the effect of foreign currency exchange fluctuations, and we may choose not to hedge certain exposures. We designate these contracts as cash flow hedges of forecasted foreign currency revenue and initially record the gains or losses on these derivative instruments as a component of AOCI and reclassify the amounts into “Revenues” on the Consolidated Statements of Operations in the same period the forecasted transaction affects earnings. If the U.S dollar weakened by 10% as of December\xa031, 2024 and December\xa031, 2023, the amount recorded in AOCI related to our foreign exchange contracts, before taxes, would have been approximately $1.9\xa0billion and $958\xa0million lower, respectively. This adverse change in AOCI would be expected to offset a corresponding favorable foreign currency change in the underlying forecasted revenues when recognized in earnings.\n\nWe enter into foreign exchange forward contracts to mitigate fluctuations in forecasted and firmly committed U.S. dollar-equivalent transactions related to the licensing and production of content assets from changes in foreign currency exchange rates. These contracts may reduce, but do not entirely eliminate, the effect of foreign currency exchange fluctuations, and we may choose not to hedge certain exposures. We designate these contracts as cash flow hedges and initially record the gains or losses on these derivative instruments as a component of AOCI and reclassify the amounts into “Cost of Revenues” to offset the hedged exposures as they affect earnings, which occurs as the underlying hedged content assets are amortized. If the U.S dollar strengthened by 10% as of December\xa031, 2024 and December\xa031, 2023, the amount recorded in AOCI related to our foreign exchange contracts, before taxes, would have been approximately $187\xa0million and $71\xa0million lower, respectively. This adverse change in AOCI would be expected to offset a corresponding favorable foreign currency change in the underlying exposures when recognized in earnings.\n\n27', 'Table of Contents\n\nWe use non-derivative instruments to mitigate foreign exchange risk related to our net investments in certain foreign subsidiaries. These non-derivative instruments may reduce, but do not entirely eliminate, the effect of foreign currency exchange fluctuations, and we may choose not to hedge certain exposures. We designate a portion of our foreign currency-denominated Senior Notes in euros as net investment hedges and the gains or losses on these non-derivative instruments are reported as a component of AOCI and remain in AOCI until the hedged net investment is sold or liquidated, at which point the amounts recognized in AOCI are reclassified into earnings.\n\nWe have also experienced and will continue to experience fluctuations in our net income as a result of gains (losses) on the settlement and the remeasurement of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies that are not the functional currency. In the year ended December\xa031, 2024, we began entering into foreign exchange forward contracts to mitigate the foreign exchange risk on intercompany transactions and monetary assets and liabilities that are not denominated in the functional currencies of the Company and its subsidiaries. These contracts may reduce, but do not entirely eliminate, the effect of foreign currency exchange fluctuations, and we may choose not to hedge certain exposures. Certain contracts are not designated as hedging instruments and the gains or losses on these derivative instruments are recorded in “Interest and other income (expense)” in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. We also designate certain contracts as fair value hedges to mitigate the foreign exchange risk on the remeasurement of our foreign-currency denominated debt. The gains or losses on these derivative instruments included in the assessment of hedge effectiveness are recorded in “Interest and other income (expense),” net with the offsetting foreign currency remeasurement gains and losses on the hedged items. If an adverse change in exchange rates of 10% was applied to our monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currencies as of December\xa031, 2024 and December\xa031, 2023, income before income taxes would have been approximately $38\xa0million and $516\xa0million lower, respectively, after considering the offsetting impact of the foreign currency exchange contracts and our net investment hedges. The decrease in the hypothetical adverse change in income before taxes from $516\xa0million as of December\xa031, 2023 to $38\xa0million as of December\xa031, 2024 is primarily driven by our use of non-derivative and derivative instruments to mitigate foreign exchange risk related to the remeasurement of foreign-currency denominated balances during the year ended December\xa031, 2024.\n\nItem 8.Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\n\nThe consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes listed in Part IV, Item\xa015(a)(1) of this Annual Report on Form 10-K are included immediately following Part IV hereof and incorporated by reference herein.\n\nItem 9.Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure\n\nNone.\n\n28', 'Table of Contents\n\nItem 9A.Controls and Procedures\n\n(a)Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\n\nOur management, with the participation of our co-Chief Executive Officers and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Based on that evaluation, our co-Chief Executive Officers and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K were effective in providing reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission’s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our co-Chief Executive Officers and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures.\n\nOur management, including our co-Chief Executive Officers and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal controls will prevent all error and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within Netflix have been detected.\n\n(b)Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\n\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) of the Exchange Act). Our management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December\xa031, 2024. In making this assessment, our management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (“COSO”) in Internal Control—Integrated Framework (2013 framework). Based on our assessment under the framework in Internal Control—Integrated Framework (2013 framework), our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December\xa031, 2024. The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December\xa031, 2024 has been audited by Ernst & Young LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report that is included herein.\n\n(c)Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\n\nThere was no change in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended December\xa031, 2024 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\n\n29', 'Table of Contents\n\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\n\nTo the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of Netflix, Inc.\n\nOpinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\n\nWe have audited Netflix, Inc.’s internal control over financial reporting as of December\xa031, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). In our opinion, Netflix, Inc. (the Company) maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December\xa031, 2024, based on the COSO criteria.\n\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of December\xa031, 2024 and 2023, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, stockholders’ equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December\xa031, 2024, and the related notes and our report dated January\xa027, 2025 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.\n\nBasis for Opinion\n\nThe Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\n\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.\n\nOur audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\n\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\n\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\n\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|  | | | /s/ Ernst & Young LLP | | |\n| San Jose, California | | |  | | |\n| January 27, 2025 | | |  | | |\n\n30', 'Table of Contents\n\nItem 9B.Other Information\n\nRule 10b5-1 Trading Plans\n\nThe adoption or termination of contracts, instructions or written plans for the purchase or sale of our securities by our Section 16 officers and directors for the three months ended December 31, 2024, each of which is intended to satisfy the affirmative defense conditions of Rule 10b5-1(c) under the Exchange Act (“Rule 10b5-1 Plan”), were as follows:\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| Name | | |  | | | Title | | |  | | | Action | | |  | | | Date Adopted | | |  | | | Expiration Date | | |  | | | Aggregate # of Securities to be Purchased/Sold | | |\n| Greg Peters (1) | | |  | | | Co-CEO and Director | | |  | | | Termination | | |  | | | 10/30/2024 | | |  | | | N/A | | |  | | | 187,913 | | |\n| Greg Peters (2) | | |  | | | Co-CEO and Director | | |  | | | Adoption | | |  | | | 10/30/2024 | | |  | | | 11/1/2027 | | |  | | | 158,583 | | |\n| David Hyman (3) | | |  | | | Chief Legal Officer | | |  | | | Adoption | | |  | | | 10/29/2024 | | |  | | | 1/30/2026 | | |  | | | 104,154 | | |\n| Ted Sarandos (4) | | |  | | | Co-CEO and Director | | |  | | | Adoption | | |  | | | 10/25/2024 | | |  | | | 2/27/2026 | | |  | | | 199,063 | | |\n| Spencer Neumann (5) | | |  | | | Chief Financial Officer | | |  | | | Adoption | | |  | | | 10/29/2024 | | |  | | | 12/31/2025 | | |  | | | 33,406 | | |\n| Ann Mather (6) | | |  | | | Director | | |  | | | Adoption | | |  | | | 10/31/2024 | | |  | | | 12/31/2025 | | |  | | | 2,682 | | |\n| Strive Masiyiwa (7) | | |  | | | Director | | |  | | | Adoption | | |  | | | 11/7/2024 | | |  | | | 12/31/2025 | | |  | | | 2,813 | | |\n| Jeffrey Karbowski (8) | | |  | | | Chief Accounting Officer | | |  | | | Adoption | | |  | | | 10/29/2024 | | |  | | | 1/31/2026 | | |  | | | 3,820 | | |\n\n|  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|  |  |  |\n| (1) On October 30, 2024, Greg Peters, Co-CEO and a member of the Board of Directors, terminated a pre-arranged stock trading plan pursuant to Rule 10b5-1, which was adopted on July 26, 2023 and provided for the potential exercise of vested stock options and the associated sale of up to 187,913 shares of Netflix common stock until November 1, 2027 or the earlier completion of all authorized transactions under the plan. | | |\n| (2) Upon termination of Mr. Peters\' prior plan (described in footnote 1), on October 30, 2024, Mr. Peters entered into a pre-arranged stock trading plan pursuant to Rule 10b5-1 that provides for the potential exercise of vested stock options and the associated sale of up to 158,583 shares of Netflix common stock.

Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks.

The Company amortizes Content based on factors including historical and estimated viewing patterns.  Auditing the amortization of the Company’s Content is complex and subjective due to the judgmental nature of amortization which is based on an estimate of future viewing patterns. Estimated viewing patterns are based on historical and forecasted viewing. If actual viewing patterns differ from these estimates, the pattern and/or period of amortization would be changed and could affect the timing of recognition of content amortization. | | |\n|  | | |  | | |\n| How We Addressed the  Matter in Our Audit | | | We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over the content amortization process. For example, we tested controls over management’s review of the content amortization method and the significant assumptions, including the historical and forecasted viewing hour consumption, used to develop estimated viewing patterns. We also tested management’s controls to determine that the data used in the model was complete and accurate.  To test content amortization, our audit procedures included, among others, evaluating the content amortization method, testing the significant assumptions used to develop the estimated viewing patterns and testing the completeness and accuracy of the underlying data. For example, we assessed management’s assumptions by comparing them to current viewing trends and current operating information including comparing previous estimates of viewing patterns to actual results. We also performed sensitivity analyses to evaluate the potential changes in the content amortization recorded that could result from changes in the assumptions. | | |\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- |

Contents\n\nNETFLIX, INC.\n\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\n1.Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\n\nDescription of Business\n\nNetflix, Inc. (the “Company”) was incorporated on August\xa029, 1997 and began operations on April\xa014, 1998. The Company is one of the world’s leading entertainment services with approximately 302 million paid memberships in over 190 countries enjoying TV series, films and games across a wide variety of genres and languages. Members can play, pause and resume watching as much as they want, anytime, anywhere, and can change their plans at any time.\n\nBasis of Presentation\n\nThe consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. Intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated.\n\nUse of Estimates\n\nThe preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Significant items subject to such estimates and assumptions include the content asset amortization policy and the recognition and measurement of income tax assets and liabilities. The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that the Company believes to be reasonable under the circumstances. On an ongoing basis, the Company evaluates these assumptions, judgments and estimates. Actual results may differ from these estimates.\n\nRecently issued accounting pronouncements not yet adopted\n\nIn December 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures, which requires public entities, on an annual basis, to provide disclosure of specific categories in the rate reconciliation, as well as disclosure of income taxes paid disaggregated by jurisdiction. ASU 2023-09 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024, with early adoption permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting ASU 2023-09.\n\nIn November 2024, the FASB issued ASU 2024-03, Income Statement-Reporting Comprehensive Income-Expense Disaggregation Disclosures (Subtopic 220-40): Disaggregation of Income Statement Expenses, requiring public entities to disclose additional information about specific expense categories in the notes to the financial statements on an interim and annual basis. ASU 2024-03 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2026, and for interim periods beginning after December 15, 2027, with early adoption permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting ASU 2024-03.\n\nRecently adopted accounting pronouncements\n\nIn November 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures, requiring public entities to disclose information about their reportable segments’ significant expenses and other segment items on an interim and annual basis. Public entities with a single reportable segment are required to apply the disclosure requirements in ASU 2023-07, as well as all existing segment disclosures and reconciliation requirements in ASC 280 on an interim and annual basis. The Company adopted ASU 2023-07 during the year ended December 31, 2024. See Note 12 Segment and Geographic Information in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements for further detail.\n\nCash Equivalents and Short-term Investments\n\nThe Company considers investments in instruments purchased with an original maturity of 90 days or less to be cash equivalents. The Company also classifies amounts in transit from payment processors for customer credit card and debit card transactions that it expects to settle within several days as cash equivalents.\n\nThe Company classifies short-term investments, which consist of marketable securities with original maturities in excess of 90 days as available-for-sale. Short-term investments are reported at fair value, with allowances for credit losses included in “Interest and other income (expense)” in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and unrealized gains and losses included in “Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)” within Stockholders’ equity in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Company uses the specific identification method to determine cost in calculating realized gains and losses upon the sale of short-term investments.\n\n42', 'Table of Contents\n\nShort-term investments are reviewed periodically for allowances for credit losses and impairment. When evaluating the investments, the Company reviews factors such as the extent to which the fair value of the security is less than the amortized cost basis, adverse conditions specifically related to the security, the financial condition of the issuer, the Company’s intent to sell, and whether it would be more likely than not that the Company would be required to sell the investments before the recovery of their amortized cost basis.\n\nContent\n\nThe Company acquires, licenses and produces content, including original programming, in order to offer members unlimited viewing of video entertainment. The content licenses are for a fixed fee and specific windows of availability. Payment terms for certain content licenses and the production of content require more upfront cash payments relative to the amortization expense. Payments for content, including additions to content assets and the changes in related liabilities, are classified within "Net cash provided by operating activities" on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.\n\nThe Company recognizes content assets (licensed and produced) as “Content assets, net” on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. For licensed content, the Company capitalizes the fee per title and records a corresponding liability at the gross amount of the liability when the license period begins, the cost of the title is known and the title is accepted and available for streaming. For produced content, the Company capitalizes costs associated with the production, including development costs, direct costs and production overhead.\n\nBased on factors including historical and estimated viewing patterns, the Company amortizes the content assets (licensed and produced) in “Cost of revenues” on the Consolidated Statements of Operations over the shorter of each title\'s contractual window of availability or estimated period of use over ten years, beginning with the month of first availability. The amortization is on an accelerated basis, as the Company typically expects more upfront viewing, and film amortization is more accelerated than TV series amortization. On average, over 90% of a licensed or produced content asset is expected to be amortized within four years after its month of first availability. The Company reviews factors impacting the amortization of the content assets on a regular basis. The Company\'s estimates related to these factors require considerable management judgment.\n\nIn the normal course of business, the Company, or a third-party producing content on the Company\'s behalf, may qualify for tax incentives through eligible spend on productions. The accounting for tax incentives is dependent on the particular type of incentive, including the nature of the benefit and the location the incentive is earned. In general, tax incentives are realized as cash receipts and may be received prior to or after a title launches on the Company’s service. Upon a title’s launch, any amounts the Company is eligible for through qualified production spend but has not received, are recognized in “Other current assets” or “Other non-current assets” on the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets as receivables. Tax incentives are generally accounted for as a reduction to the cost basis of the Company’s content assets (presented in “Content assets, net”) and reduce content amortization over the life of the title (as presented in “Cost of revenues”) on the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\n\nThe Company\'s business model is subscription based as opposed to a model generating revenues at a specific title level. Content assets (licensed and produced) are predominantly monetized as a group and therefore are reviewed in aggregate at a group level when an event or change in circumstances indicates a change in the expected usefulness of the content or that the fair value may be less than unamortized cost. To date, the Company has not identified any such event or changes in circumstances. If such changes are identified in the future, these aggregated content assets will be stated at the lower of unamortized cost or fair value. In addition, unamortized costs for assets that have been, or are expected to be, abandoned are written off.\n\nAcquisitions\n\nThe Company uses its best estimates and assumptions to assign fair value to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date. In addition, uncertain tax positions, tax-related valuation allowances and pre-acquisition contingencies are initially recorded in connection with a business combination as of the acquisition date.\n\nProperty and Equipment\n\nProperty and equipment are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method over the shorter of the estimated useful lives of the respective assets, generally up to 30 years, or the expected lease term for leasehold improvements, if applicable.\n\nTrade Receivables\n\nTrade receivables primarily consist of membership and advertising fees due to the Company. The Company evaluates the need for an allowance for credit losses based on historical collection trends, the financial condition of its payment partners, and external market factors.\n\nRevenue Recognition\n\nThe Company\'s primary source of revenues is from monthly membership fees. Members are billed in advance of the start of their monthly membership and revenues are recognized ratably over each monthly membership period. Revenues are presented net of the taxes that\n\n43', 'Table of Contents\n\nare collected from members and remitted to governmental authorities. The Company is the principal in all its relationships where partners, including consumer electronics ("CE") manufacturers, multichannel video programming distributors ("MVPDs"), mobile operators and internet service providers ("ISPs"), provide access to the service as the Company retains control over service delivery to its members. In circumstances in which the price that the member pays is established by a partner and there is no standalone price for the Netflix service (for instance, in a bundle), the net amount collected from the partner is recognized as revenue.\n\nThe Company also earns revenue from advertisements presented on its streaming service, consumer products, live events and various other sources. Revenues earned from sources other than monthly membership fees were not a material component of revenues for the years ended December\xa031, 2024, 2023, and 2022. See Note 2 Revenue Recognition to the consolidated financial statements for further information regarding revenues.\n\nSales and Marketing\n\nSales and marketing expenses consist primarily of advertising expenses and certain payments made to marketing and advertising sales partners, including CE manufacturers, MVPDs, mobile operators and ISPs. Sales and marketing expenses also include payroll, stock-based compensation, facilities, and other related expenses for personnel that support the Company\'s advertising sales and marketing activities. Marketing expenses are expensed as incurred and include promotional activities such as digital and television advertising. Advertising expenses were $1,779 million, $1,732 million and $1,586 million for the years ended December\xa031, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\n\nIncome Taxes\n\nThe Company records a provision for income taxes for the anticipated tax consequences of the reported results of operations using the asset and liability method. Deferred income taxes are recognized by applying enacted statutory tax rates applicable to future years to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases as well as net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. The measurement of deferred tax assets is reduced, if necessary, by a valuation allowance for any tax benefits for which future realization is uncertain. The Company accounts for the tax effects of global intangible low tax income as a current period expense.\n\nThe Company does not recognize certain tax benefits from uncertain tax positions within the provision for income taxes. The Company may recognize a tax benefit only if it is more likely than not the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such positions are then measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon settlement. The Company recognizes interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions in income tax expense. See Note 10 Income Taxes to the consolidated financial statements for further information regarding income taxes.\n\nForeign Currency\n\nThe functional currency for the Company\'s subsidiaries is determined based on the primary economic environment in which the subsidiary operates. The Company translates the assets and liabilities of its non-U.S. dollar functional currency subsidiaries into U.S. dollars using exchange rates in effect at the end of each period. Revenues and expenses for these subsidiaries are translated using rates that approximate those in effect during the period. Gains and losses from these translations are recognized in cumulative translation adjustment included in "Accumulated other comprehensive income" in Stockholders’ equity on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\n\nThe Company remeasures monetary assets and liabilities that are not denominated in the functional currency at exchange rates in effect at the end of each period. Gains and losses from these remeasurements are recognized in "Interest and other income (expense)" in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Foreign exchange gains (losses) were $(18) million, $(293) million, and $282\xa0million for the years ended December\xa031, 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively. These gains and losses were primarily due to the non-cash remeasurement of our Senior Notes denominated in euros and the remeasurement of cash and content liability positions denominated in currencies other than functional currencies. Foreign exchange gains (losses) for the year ended December\xa031, 2024 were net of hedging impacts. No hedging gains or losses were recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Operations in the years ended December\xa031, 2023 and 2022. See Note 7 Derivative Financial Instruments and Hedging Activities for further information.\n\nDerivative Financial Instruments and Hedging Activities\n\nThe Company uses derivative and non-derivative instruments to manage foreign exchange risk related to its ongoing business operations with the primary objective of reducing earnings and cash flow volatility associated with fluctuations in foreign exchange rates.\n\nThe Company recognizes derivative instruments at fair value as either assets (presented in “Other current assets” and “Other non-current assets”) or liabilities (presented in “Accrued expenses and other liabilities” and “Other non-current liabilities”) on the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Company classifies derivative instruments in the Level 2 category within the fair value hierarchy.\n\nCash flow hedges\n\n44', 'Table of Contents\n\nThe Company enters into forward contracts to manage the foreign exchange risk on forecasted revenue transactions denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, as well as the foreign exchange risk on forecasted transactions and firm commitments related to the licensing and production of foreign currency-denominated content assets. These forward contracts are designated as cash flow hedges of foreign currency firm commitments and forecasted transactions and generally have maturities of 36 months or less. The hedging contracts may reduce, but do not entirely eliminate, the effect of foreign currency exchange movements, and the Company may choose not to hedge certain exposures.\n\nThe gain or loss on derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges of forecasted foreign currency revenue is initially reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (“AOCI”) and reclassified into “Revenues” on the Consolidated Statements of Operations in the same period the forecasted transaction affects earnings. The gain or loss on derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges of firmly committed or forecasted transactions related to the licensing and production of content assets is initially reported as a component of AOCI and reclassified into “Cost of Revenues” on the Consolidated Statements of Operations in the same period the hedged transaction affects earnings, which occurs as the underlying hedged content assets are amortized. Cash flows from hedging activities are classified in the same category as the cash flows for the underlying item being hedged within "Net cash provided by operating activities" on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.\n\nIn the event that the likelihood of occurrence of the underlying forecasted transactions is determined to be probable not to occur, the gains or losses on the related cash flow hedges are reclassified from AOCI to “Interest and other income (expense)” in the Consolidated Statements of Operations in the period of dedesignation.\n\nFair value hedges\n\nThe Company designates forward contracts as fair value hedges to manage the foreign exchange risk on its foreign-currency denominated debt. These hedges may reduce, but do not entirely eliminate, the effect of foreign currency exchange movements, and the Company may choose not to hedge the full amount of its exposure. The gain or loss on derivative instruments designated as fair value hedges included in the assessment of hedge effectiveness is recognized in “Interest and other income (expense),” net with the offsetting foreign currency remeasurement gains and losses on the hedged items. The Company excludes forward points from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and recognizes the initial value of the excluded component over the life of the hedging instrument in “Interest and other income (expense)” on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The difference between changes in fair value of the excluded component and the amount recognized in earnings is recognized as a component in AOCI. Cash flows from hedging activities are classified in the same category as the cash flows for the underlying item being hedged within "Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities" on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.\n\nNet investment hedges\n\nThe Company designates a portion of its foreign currency-denominated debt as net investment hedges to manage the foreign exchange risk on its investment in certain foreign subsidiaries. These hedges may reduce, but do not entirely eliminate, the effect of foreign currency exchange movements, and the Company may choose not to hedge certain exposures. The gains or losses on these non-derivative instruments are reported as a component of AOCI as part of the cumulative translation adjustment on the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets. The accumulated gains and losses remain in AOCI until the hedged net investment is sold or liquidated, at which point the amounts recognized in AOCI are reclassified into earnings.\n\nDerivative instruments not designated as hedging instruments\n\nThe Company enters into forward contracts to manage the foreign exchange risk on intercompany transactions and monetary assets and liabilities that are not denominated in the functional currencies of the Company and its subsidiaries. These derivative instruments are not designated as hedging instruments and may reduce, but do not entirely eliminate, the effect of foreign currency exchange movements. The gains or losses on derivative instruments not designated as hedging instruments are recorded in “Interest and other income (expense)” in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Cash flows related to these derivative instruments are classified within "Net cash provided by operating activities" on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.\n\nSee Note 7 Derivative Financial Instruments and Hedging Activities to the consolidated financial statements for further information regarding the Company’s derivative and non-derivative financial instruments.\n\nStock-Based Compensation\n\nThe Company grants non-qualified stock options to its employees on a monthly basis. For certain executive officers, the Company grants restricted stock units ("RSUs") and performance-based restricted stock units ("PSUs"). Stock-based compensation expense is based on the fair value of the stock awards at the grant date and is recognized, net of forfeitures, over the requisite service period. See Note 9 Stockholders\' Equity to the consolidated financial statements for further information regarding stock-based compensation.\n\n2.Revenue Recognition\n\nThe following tables summarize streaming revenues, paid net membership additions (losses), and ending paid memberships by region for the years ended December\xa031, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Hedging gains of $124\xa0million are included in “Streaming revenues” for the\n\n45', 'Table of Contents\n\nyear ended December\xa031, 2024. No hedging gains and losses were recognized as “Streaming revenues” in the comparative prior year periods.

Certain members have the option to add extra member sub accounts. These extra member sub accounts are not included in paid memberships. A membership is canceled and ceases to be reflected in the above metrics as of the effective cancellation date. Voluntary cancellations generally become effective at the end of the prepaid membership period. Involuntary cancellations, as a result of a failed method of payment, become effective immediately. Memberships are assigned to territories based on the geographic location used at time of sign-up as determined by the Company’s internal systems, which utilize industry standard geo-location technology.\n\n46', 'Table of Contents\n\nDeferred revenue primarily consists of membership fees billed that have not been recognized, as well as gift and other prepaid memberships that have not been fully redeemed. As of December 31, 2024, total deferred revenue was $1,521\xa0million, the vast majority of which was related to membership fees billed that are expected to be recognized as revenue within the next month. The remaining deferred revenue balance, which is related to gift cards and other prepaid memberships, will be recognized as revenue over the period of service after redemption, which is expected to occur over the next 12 months. The $78 million increase in deferred revenue as compared to the balance of $1,443\xa0million for the year ended December\xa031, 2023, is a result of the increase in membership fees billed due to increased memberships and price increases.\n\n3.Earnings per Share\n\nBasic earnings per share is computed using the weighted-average number of outstanding shares of common stock during the period. Diluted earnings per share is computed using the weighted-average number of outstanding shares of common stock and, when dilutive, potential outstanding shares of common stock during the period. Potential outstanding shares of common stock are calculated using the treasury-stock method and consist of incremental shares issuable upon the assumed exercise of stock options and vesting of time-based and performance-based restricted stock units. The computation of earnings per share is as follows:\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|  | | | Year Ended December\xa031, | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |\n|  | | | 2024 | | |  | | | 2023 | | |  | | | 2022 | | |\n|  | | | (in\xa0thousands,\xa0except\xa0per\xa0share\xa0data) | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |\n| Basic earnings per share: | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |\n| Net income | | | $ | 8,711,631 |  |  | | | $ | 5,407,990 |  |  | | | $ | 4,491,924 |  |\n| Shares used in computation: | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |\n| Weighted-average shares of common stock outstanding | | | 429,519 | |  |  | | | 441,571 | |  |  | | | 444,698 | |  |\n| Basic earnings per share | | | $ | 20.28 |  |  | | | $ | 12.25 |  |  | | | $ | 10.10 |  |\n| Diluted earnings per share: | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |\n| Net income | | | $ | 8,711,631 |  |  | | | $ | 5,407,990 |  |  | | | $ | 4,491,924 |  |\n| Shares used in computation: | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |\n| Weighted-average shares of common stock outstanding | | | 429,519 | |  |  | | | 441,571 | |  |  | | | 444,698 | |  |\n| Effect of dilutive stock-based awards | | | 9,742 | |  |  | | | 7,927 | |  |  | | | 6,592 | |  |\n| Weighted-average number of shares | | | 439,261 | |  |  | | | 449,498 | |  |  | | | 451,290 | |  |\n| Diluted earnings per share | | | $ | 19.83 |  |  | | | $ | 12.03 |  |  | | | $ | 9.95 |  |\n\nThe following table summarizes the potential shares of common stock excluded from the diluted calculation as their inclusion would have been anti-dilutive:\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|  | | | Year\xa0Ended\xa0December\xa031, | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |\n|  | | | 2024 | | |  | | | 2023 | | |  | | | 2022 | | |\n|  | | | (in thousands) | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |\n| Stock-based awards | | | 243 | |  |  | | | 4,109 | |  |  | | | 6,790 | |  |\n\n47', "Table of Contents\n\n4.Cash, Cash Equivalents, Restricted Cash, and Short-term Investments\n\nThe Company classifies short-term investments, which consist of marketable securities with original maturities in excess of 90 days as available-for-sale (“AFS”). The Company does not buy and hold securities principally for the purpose of selling them in the near future. The Company’s policy is focused on the preservation of capital, liquidity and return.

These leases generally have terms which range from 1 year to 15 years, and often include one or more options to renew. These renewal terms can extend the lease term from 1 year to 20 years, and are included in the lease term when it is reasonably certain that the Company will exercise the option. These operating leases are included in "Other non-current assets" on the Company\'s Consolidated Balance Sheets, and represent the Company’s right to use the underlying asset for the lease term. The Company’s obligations to make lease payments are included in "Accrued expenses and other liabilities" and "Other non-current liabilities" on the Company\'s Consolidated Balance Sheets. \xa0Operating lease right-of-use assets and liabilities are recognized at the commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. The Company has entered into various short-term operating leases with an initial term of twelve months or less. These leases are not recorded on the Company\'s Consolidated Balance Sheets. All operating lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Because the rate implicit in each lease is not readily determinable, the Company uses its incremental borrowing rate to determine the present value of the lease payments. The Company has certain contracts for real estate which may contain lease and non-lease components which it has elected to treat as a single lease component.\n\nThe components of lease costs for the years ended December\xa031, 2024, 2023 and 2022 were as follows:\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|  | | | Year ended December 31, | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |\n|  | | | 2024 | | |  | | | 2023 | | |  | | | 2022 | | |\n|  | | | (in thousands) | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |\n| Operating lease cost | | | $ | 468,282 |  |  | | | $ | 430,856 |  |  | | | $ | 413,664 |  |\n| Short-term lease cost | | | 197,691 | |  |  | | | 207,822 | |  |  | | | 194,764 | |  |\n| Total lease cost | | | $ | 665,973 |  |  | | | $ | 638,678 |  |  | | | $ | 608,428 |  |\n\nInformation related to the Company\'s operating right-of-use assets and related operating lease liabilities were as follows:\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|  | | | Year ended December 31, | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |\n|  | | | 2024 | | |  | | | 2023 | | |  | | | 2022 | | |\n|  | | | (in thousands) | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |\n| Cash paid for operating lease liabilities | | | $ | 509,296 |  |  | | | $ | 451,525 |  |  | | | $ | 413,034 |  |\n| Right-of-use assets obtained in exchange for new operating lease obligations | | | 442,391 | |  |  | | | 196,639 | |  |  | | | 252,393 | |  |\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|  | | | As of December 31, | | | | | | | | |\n|  | | | 2024 | | |  | | | 2023 | | |\n|  | | | (in thousands, except lease term and discount rate) | | | | | | | | |\n| Operating lease right-of-use assets, net | | | $ | 2,102,310 |  |  | | | $ | 2,076,899 |  |\n|  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |\n| Current operating lease liabilities | | | $ | 428,482 |  |  | | | $ | 383,312 |  |\n| Non-current operating lease liabilities | | | 1,983,688 | |  |  | | | 2,046,801 | |  |\n| Total operating lease liabilities | | | $ | 2,412,170 |  |  | | | $ | 2,430,113 |  |\n|  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |\n| Weighted-average remaining lease term | | | 6.9 years | | |  | | | 7.5 years | | |\n| Weighted-average discount rate | | | 3.5 | | % |  | | | 3.3 | | % |\n\nMaturities of operating lease liabilities as of December\xa031, 2024 were as follows (in thousands):\n\n50', "Table of Contents\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| Due in 12 month period ended December 31, | | | | | |\n| 2025 | | | $ | 505,201 |  |\n| 2026 | | | 477,256 | |  |\n| 2027 | | | 415,983 | |  |\n| 2028 | | | 345,912 | |  |\n| 2029 | | | 276,109 | |  |\n| Thereafter | | | 696,367 | |  |\n|  | | | 2,716,828 | |  |\n| Less imputed interest | | | (304,658) | |  |\n| Total operating lease liabilities | | | $ | 2,412,170 |  |\n\nThe Company has additional operating leases for real estate of $38 million which have not commenced as of December\xa031, 2024, and as such, have not been recognized on the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets.

The applicable margin for Alternate Base Rate loans will range from 0.00% to 0.25%, and the applicable margin for Adjusted Term SOFR Rate loans will range from 0.75% to 1.25%, each based on the Company’s credit ratings.\n\nThe Revolving Credit Agreement contains customary affirmative covenants and negative covenants (and customary baskets and exceptions with respect thereto) for a credit facility of this size and type and requires the Company to maintain a minimum ratio of consolidated EBITDA to consolidated interest expense of 3.0 to 1.0 as of the last day of each fiscal quarter. As of\xa0December\xa031, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company was in compliance with all related covenants and ratios.\n\n7.Derivative Financial Instruments and Hedging Activities\n\nThe Company uses derivative and non-derivative instruments to manage foreign exchange risk related to its ongoing business operations with the primary objective of reducing earnings and cash flow volatility associated with fluctuations in foreign exchange rates.

These instruments are valued using industry standard valuation models that use observable inputs such as interest rate yield curves, and forward and spot prices for currencies.\n\nAs of December\xa031, 2024, the pre-tax net accumulated gain on our foreign currency cash flow hedges included in AOCI on the Consolidated Balance Sheets expected to be recognized in earnings within the next 12 months is $564\xa0million.\n\nMaster Netting Agreements\n\nIn order to mitigate counterparty credit risk, the Company enters into master netting agreements with its counterparties for its foreign currency exchange contracts which permit the parties to settle amounts on a net basis under certain conditions. The Company has elected to present its derivative assets and liabilities on a gross basis on its Consolidated Balance Sheets.\n\nThe Company also enters into collateral security arrangements with its counterparties that require the parties to post cash collateral when certain contractual thresholds are met. Cash collateral received is presented in “Accrued expenses and other liabilities” representing the Company’s obligation to return counterparty cash collateral. Cash collateral posted is presented in “Other current assets” representing the Company’s right to reclaim the cash collateral. The Company does not offset the fair value of its derivative instruments against the fair value of cash collateral posted or received.\n\nThe potential offsetting effect to the Company’s derivative assets and liabilities under its master netting agreements and collateral security agreements were as follows:\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |

2023 and December\xa031, 2022.\n\n8. Commitments and Contingencies\n\nContent\n\nAt December\xa031, 2024, the Company had $23.2 billion of obligations comprised of $4.4 billion included in "Current content liabilities" and $1.8 billion of "Non-current content liabilities" on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and $17.0 billion of obligations that are not reflected on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as they did not yet meet the criteria for recognition.\n\nAt December\xa031, 2023, the Company had $21.7 billion of obligations comprised of $4.5 billion included in "Current content liabilities" and $2.6 billion of "Non-current content liabilities" on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and $14.6 billion of obligations that are not reflected on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as they did not yet meet the criteria for recognition.\n\nThe expected timing of payments for these content obligations is as follows:\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|  | | | As of December 31, | | | | | | | | |\n|  | | | 2024 | | |  | | | 2023 | | |\n|  | | | (in\xa0thousands) | | | | | | | | |\n| Less than one year | | | $ | 11,424,696 |  |  | | | $ | 10,328,923 |  |\n| Due after one year and through three years | | | 8,113,910 | |  |  | | | 8,784,302 | |  |\n| Due after three years and through five years | | | 2,809,834 | |  |  | | | 2,016,358 | |  |\n| Due after five years | | | 900,491 | |  |  | | | 583,766 | |  |\n| Total content obligations | | | $ | 23,248,931 |  |  | | | $ | 21,713,349 |  |\n\nContent obligations include amounts related to the acquisition, licensing and production of content. Obligations that are in non-U.S. dollar currencies are translated to the U.S. dollar at period end rates. An obligation for the production of content includes non-cancelable commitments under creative talent and employment agreements as well as other production related commitments. An obligation for the acquisition and licensing of content is incurred at the time the Company enters into an agreement to obtain future titles. Once a title becomes available, a content liability is recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Certain agreements include the obligation to license rights for unknown future titles, the ultimate quantity and/or fees for which are not yet determinable as of the reporting date. Traditional film output deals, or certain TV series license agreements where the number of seasons to be aired is unknown, are examples of such license agreements. The Company does not include any estimated obligation for these future titles beyond the known minimum amount. However, the unknown obligations are expected to be significant.\n\nLegal Proceedings\n\nFrom time to time, in the normal course of its operations, the Company is subject to litigation matters and claims, including claims relating to employee relations, business practices and patent infringement. Litigation can be expensive and disruptive to normal business operations. Moreover, the results of complex legal proceedings are difficult to predict and the Company\'s view of these matters may change in the future as the litigation and events related thereto unfold. The Company expenses legal fees as incurred. The Company records a provision for contingent losses when it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. An unfavorable outcome to any legal matter, if material, could have an adverse effect on the Company\'s operations or its financial position, liquidity or results of operations.\n\nThe Company is involved in litigation matters not listed herein but does not consider the matters to be material either individually or in the aggregate at this time. The Company\'s view of the matters not listed may change in the future as the litigation and events related thereto unfold.\n\nNon-Income Taxes\n\nThe Company is routinely under audit by various tax authorities with regard to non-income tax matters. The subject matter of non-income tax audits primarily arises from disputes on the tax treatment and tax rate applied to our revenue in certain jurisdictions. We accrue non-income taxes that may result from examinations by, or any negotiated agreements with, these tax authorities when a loss is probable and reasonably estimable.\n\nSimilar to other U.S. companies doing business in Brazil, the Company is involved in a number of matters with Brazilian tax authorities regarding non-income tax assessments. Although the Company believes it has meritorious defenses to these matters, there is inherent complexity and uncertainty with respect to these matters, and the final outcome may be materially different from our expectations. The current potential exposure with respect to the various issues with Brazilian tax authorities regarding non-income tax assessments is estimated to be approximately $400\xa0million, which is expected to increase over time.\n\n56', 'Table of Contents\n\nGuarantees—Indemnification Obligations\n\nIn the ordinary course of business, the Company has entered into contractual arrangements under which it has agreed to provide indemnification of varying scope and terms to business partners and other parties with respect to certain matters, including, but not limited to, losses arising out of the Company’s breach of such agreements and out of intellectual property infringement claims made by third parties. In these circumstances, payment may be conditional on the other party making a claim pursuant to the procedures specified in the particular contract.\n\nThe Company’s obligations under these agreements may be limited in terms of time or amount, and in some instances, the Company may have recourse against third parties for certain payments. In addition, the Company has entered into indemnification agreements with its directors and certain of its officers that will require it, among other things, to indemnify them against certain liabilities that may arise by reason of their status or service as directors or officers. The terms of such obligations vary.\n\nIt is not possible to make a reasonable estimate of the maximum potential amount of future payments under these or similar agreements due to the conditional nature of the Company’s obligations and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular agreement. No amount has been accrued in the accompanying consolidated financial statements with respect to these indemnification guarantees.\n\n57', 'Table of Contents\n\n9.Stockholders’ Equity\n\nVoting Rights\n\nThe holders of each share of common stock shall be entitled to one vote per share on all matters to be voted upon by the Company’s stockholders.\n\nStock Option Plan\n\nThe Netflix, Inc. 2020 Stock Plan is a stockholder-approved plan that provides for the grant of incentive stock options to employees and for the grant of non-statutory stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock and restricted stock units to employees, directors and consultants.\n\nRestricted Stock Unit Awards\n\nThe Company grants time-based restricted stock unit (“RSU”) awards and performance-based restricted stock unit (“PSU”) awards to certain executive officers. RSU awards vest quarterly over a three-year period subject to the executive’s continued employment or service with the Company through the vesting date. PSU awards have performance periods ranging from one to three years and vest depending on the Company’s achievement of predetermined market-based performance targets.\n\nStock Option Activity\n\nThe following table summarizes the activities related to the Company’s stock options:\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|  | | | Options Outstanding | | | | | | | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |\n|  | | | Number of Shares | | |  | | | Weighted- Average Exercise Price  (per share) | | |  | | | Weighted- Average Remaining Contractual Term (in years) | | |  | | | Aggregate  Intrinsic Value  (in thousands) | | |\n| Balances as of December 31, 2021 | | | 17,595,851 | |  |  | | | $ | 219.83 |  |  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |\n| Granted | | | 3,691,257 | |  |  | | | 267.94 | |  |  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |\n| Exercised | | | (1,383,669) | |  |  | | | 27.19 | |  |  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |\n| Expired | | | (6,578) | |  |  | | | 11.10 | |  |  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |\n| Balances as of December 31, 2022 | | | 19,896,861 | |  |  | | | $ | 242.22 |  |  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |\n| Granted | | | 1,729,218 | |  |  | | | 372.49 | |  |  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |\n| Exercised | | | (1,926,598) | |  |  | | | 87.30 | |  |  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |\n| Expired | | | (4,372) | |  |  | | | 36.39 | |  |  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |\n| Balances as of December 31, 2023 | | | 19,695,109 | |  |  | | | $ | 268.86 |  |  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |\n| Granted | | | 575,856 | |  |  | | | 620.92 | |  |  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |\n| Exercised | | | (4,846,048) | |  |  | | | 172.17 | |  |  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |\n| Expired | | | (5,915) | |  |  | | | 56.05 | |  |  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |\n| Balances as of December 31, 2024 | | | 15,419,002 | |  |  | | | $ | 312.48 |  |  | | | 5.16 | | |  | | | $ | 8,925,315 |  |\n| Vested and expected to vest as of December\xa031, 2024 | | | 15,419,002 | |  |  | | | $ | 312.48 |  |  | | | 5.16 | | |  | | | $ | 8,925,315 |  |\n| Exercisable as of December\xa031, 2024 | | | 15,401,292 | |  |  | | | $ | 312.30 |  |  | | | 5.16 | | |  | | | $ | 8,917,827 |  |\n\nThe aggregate intrinsic value in the table above represents the total pretax intrinsic value (the difference between the Company’s closing stock price on the last trading day of 2024 and the exercise price, multiplied by the number of in-the-money options) that would have been received by the option holders had all option holders exercised their options on the last trading day of 2024.

Stock repurchases may be effected through open market repurchases in compliance with Rule 10b-18 under the Exchange Act, including through the use of trading plans intended to qualify under Rule 10b5-1 under the Exchange Act, privately-negotiated transactions, accelerated stock repurchase plans, block purchases, or other similar purchase techniques and in such amounts as management deems appropriate. The Company is not obligated to repurchase any specific number of shares, and the timing and actual number of shares repurchased will depend on a variety of factors, including the Company’s stock price, general economic, business and market conditions, and alternative investment opportunities. The Company may discontinue any repurchases of its common stock at any time without prior notice. During the year ended December\xa031, 2024, the Company repurchased 9,861,935 shares for an aggregate amount of $6,211\xa0million (excluding the 1% excise tax on stock repurchases as a result of the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022).

As of December\xa031, 2024, there were no unsettled share repurchases.

carryforwards which can be carried forward indefinitely, $943\xa0million of state net operating loss carryforwards which will begin to expire in 2026, $41\xa0million of foreign tax credit carryforwards which will begin to expire in 2033, and $420\xa0million of foreign net operating loss carryforwards which will begin to expire in 2025.\n\nIn evaluating its ability to realize the net deferred tax assets, the Company considered all available positive and negative evidence, including its past operating results and the forecast of future market growth, forecasted earnings, future taxable income, and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies. As of December\xa031, 2024, the valuation allowance of $540\xa0million was primarily related to California R&D tax credits, state net operating loss carryforwards, and foreign tax credits that the Company does not expect to realize.\n\nAt December\xa031, 2024, we have not provided for applicable U.S. income and foreign withholding taxes on an immaterial amount of undistributed foreign earnings that we intend to indefinitely reinvest. For the balance of undistributed earnings for which we are not indefinitely reinvested, we have provided the appropriate taxes.\n\nThe unrecognized tax benefits that are not expected to result in payment or receipt of cash within one year are classified as “Other non-current liabilities” and a reduction of deferred tax assets which is classified as "Other non-current assets" in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of December\xa031, 2024 and 2023, the total amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits was $432\xa0million and $327\xa0million, respectively, of\n\n62', "Table of Contents\n\nwhich $251\xa0million and $188\xa0million, respectively, if recognized, would favorably impact the Company’s effective tax rate.

During the years ended December\xa031, 2024, 2023 and 2022, the Company recorded $16\xa0million, $25\xa0million, and $2\xa0million, respectively, net of interest and penalties in the provision for income taxes. The amount of interest and penalties accrued at December\xa031, 2024 and 2023 was $44\xa0million and $28\xa0million, respectively.\n\nThe Company files U.S. Federal, state and foreign tax returns. The Company is currently under examination by the IRS for years 2016 through 2018 and is subject to examination for 2019 through 2023. The Company is also generally subject to examination by various state and foreign jurisdictions for years 2017 through 2023. While the Company is in various stages of inquiry and examination with certain taxing authorities and believes that its tax positions will more likely than not be sustained, it is nonetheless possible that future obligations related to these matters could arise. The Company believes that adequate amounts have been reserved for any adjustments that may ultimately result from an examination.\n\nGiven the potential outcome of current examinations, it is reasonably possible that the balance of unrecognized tax benefits could significantly change within the next twelve months. However, an estimate of the range of reasonably possible adjustments cannot be made at this time.\n\n11.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Employee Benefit Plan\n\nThe Company maintains a 401(k) savings plan covering substantially all of its employees. Eligible employees may contribute up to 80% of their annual salary through payroll deductions, but not more than the statutory limits set by the Internal Revenue Service. The Company matches employee contributions at the discretion of the Board. During the years ended December\xa031, 2024, 2023 and 2022, the Company’s matching contributions totaled $128 million, $114 million and $102 million, respectively.\n\nMultiemployer Benefit Plans\n\nThe Company contributes to various multiemployer defined pension plans under the terms of collective bargaining agreements that cover our union-represented employees. The risks of participating in multiemployer pension plans are different from single-employer plans such that (i) contributions made by the Company to the multiemployer pension plans may be used to provide benefits to employees of other participating employers; (ii) if the Company chooses to stop participating in the multiemployer pension plans, it may be required to pay those plans an amount based on the underfunded status of the plan; and (iii) if a company stops contributing to the multiemployer pension plan, the unfunded obligations of the plan may become the obligation of the remaining participating employers. The Company also contributes to various other multiemployer benefit plans that provide health and welfare benefits to both active and retired participants. The Company does not participate in any multiemployer benefit plans that are individually significant to the Company.\n\nThe following table summarizes the Company's contributions to multiemployer pension and health plans for the years ended December\xa031, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively:\n\n63", 'Table of Contents\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|  | | | Year Ended December\xa031, | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |\n|  | | | 2024 | | |  | | | 2023 | | |  | | | 2022 | | |\n|  | | | (in thousands) | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |\n| Pension benefits | | | $ | 89,707 |  |  | | | $ | 57,285 |  |  | | | $ | 127,885 |  |\n| Health benefits | | | 134,079 | |  |  | | | 85,157 | |  |  | | | 96,285 | |  |\n| Total contributions | | | $ | 223,786 |  |  | | | $ | 142,442 |  |  | | | $ | 224,170 |  |\n\n12.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Segment and Geographic Information\n\nThe Company operates as one operating segment.

(“Netflix”, “the Company”, “registrant”, “we”, or “us”) is one of the world’s leading entertainment services with over 260 million paid memberships in over 190 countries enjoying TV series, films and games across a wide variety of genres and languages. Members can play, pause and resume watching as much as they want, anytime, anywhere, and can change their plans at any time.\n\nOur core strategy is to grow our business globally within the parameters of our operating margin target. We strive to continuously improve our members\' experience by offering compelling content that delights them and attracts new members. We seek to drive conversation around our content to further enhance member joy, and we are continuously enhancing our user interface to help our members more easily choose content that they will find enjoyable.\n\nBUSINESS SEGMENTS\n\nWe operate as one operating segment. Our revenues are primarily derived from monthly membership fees for services related to streaming content to our members. See Note 12, Segment and Geographic Information, in the accompanying notes to our consolidated financial statements for further detail.\n\nCOMPETITION\n\nThe market for entertainment video is intensely competitive and subject to rapid change. We compete with a broad set of activities for consumers’ leisure time, including other entertainment video providers, such as linear TV, streaming entertainment providers (including those that provide pirated content), video gaming providers and more broadly against other sources of entertainment, like social media, that our members could choose in their moments of free time. We also compete against entertainment video providers and content producers in obtaining content for our service, both for licensed content and for original content projects.\n\nWhile consumers may maintain simultaneous relationships with multiple entertainment sources, we strive for consumers to choose us in their moments of free time. We have often referred to this choice as our objective of "winning moments of truth." In attempting to win these moments of truth with our members, we seek to continually improve our service, including both our technology and our content offerings.\n\nSEASONALITY\n\n1', 'Table of Contents\n\nOur membership growth exhibits a seasonal pattern that reflects variations when consumers buy internet-connected screens and when they tend to increase their viewing. Historically, the fourth quarter represents our greatest streaming membership growth. In addition, our membership growth can be impacted by our content release schedule and changes to pricing and plans.\n\nINTELLECTUAL PROPERTY\n\nWe regard our trademarks, service marks, copyrights, patents, domain names, trade dress, trade secrets, proprietary technologies and similar intellectual property as important to our success. We use a combination of patent, trademark, copyright and trade secret laws and confidentiality agreements to protect our proprietary intellectual property. Our intellectual property rights extend to our technology, business processes and the content we produce and distribute through our service. We use the intellectual property of third parties in creating some of our content, merchandising our products and marketing our service. Our ability to provide our members with content they can watch depends on studios, content providers and other rights holders licensing rights, including distribution rights, to such content and certain related elements thereof, such as the public performance of music contained within the content we distribute. The license periods and the terms and conditions of such licenses vary. Our ability to protect and enforce our intellectual property rights is subject to certain risks and from time to time we encounter disputes over rights and obligations concerning intellectual property. We cannot provide assurance that we will prevail in any intellectual property disputes.\n\nREGULATION\n\nThe media landscape and the internet delivery of content have seen growing regulatory action. Historically, media has been highly regulated in many countries. We are seeing some of these legacy regulatory frameworks be updated and expanded to address services like ours. In particular, we are seeing some countries update their cultural support legislation to include services like Netflix. This includes content quotas, levies and investment obligations. Some even restrict the extent of ownership rights we can have both in our service and in our content. In certain countries, regulators are also looking at restrictions that could require formal reviews of and/or adjustments to content that appears on our service in their country. In general these regulations impact all services and may make operating in certain jurisdictions more expensive or restrictive as to the content offerings we may provide.\n\nHUMAN CAPITAL\n\nWe view our employees and our culture as key to our success. As of December\xa031, 2023, we had approximately 13,000 full-time employees. Of these, approximately 9,000 (69%) were located in the United States and Canada, 2,000 (15%) in Europe, Middle East, and Africa, 500 (4%) in Latin America and 1,500 (12%) in Asia-Pacific. We also have a number of employees engaged in content production, some of whom are part-time or temporary, and whose numbers fluctuate throughout the year. We believe a critical component of our success is our company culture. This culture, which is detailed in a "Culture Memo" located on our website, is often described as providing a unique environment for our associates to perform the best work of their lives in pursuit of excellence. We aim to attract and retain great people - representing a diverse array of perspectives and skills - to work together as a dream team. We empower all of our employees so that they can have significant impact and input into decision-making; each employee has a high degree of freedom and power to make the decisions and take actions in the best interest of the company in carrying out their role. In return, our employees are responsible and accountable for those decisions and actions. With this approach, we believe we are a more flexible, fun, stimulating, creative, collaborative and successful organization.\n\nAs we have expanded our offices globally, our company culture remains an important aspect of our operations. We are mindful of cultural differences across and within regions. Fostering a work environment that is culturally diverse, inclusive and equitable is a major focus for us. We work to build diversity, inclusion and equity into all aspects of our operations globally, with the goal of having diversity and inclusion function as a critical lens through which each Netflix employee carries out their role. We want more people and cultures to see themselves reflected on screen - so it’s important that our employee base is diverse and represents the communities we serve. We look to help increase representation by training our recruiters on how to hire more inclusively, and to help the company and senior leaders diversify their networks. We also support numerous employee resource groups (ERGs), representing employees and allies from a broad array of historically underrepresented and/or marginalized communities. We publish annually an update on our inclusion initiatives and progress, which further highlights our approach to diversity and inclusion, and publish our EEO-1 reports on our website.\n\nWe believe in fostering great leaders. We offer programs, such as seminars and lectures, that are designed to equip our leaders (officers, VPs, people managers and director and senior manager-level employees) to lead the business and our teams in alignment with our expectations and strategic goals. We have built a portfolio of programs under three foundational pillars - great company, great leaders, and great human beings - which we believe support our current and future success. We also offer programs and workshops to provide skills and coaching to employees on a variety of topics, such as leading and inspiring\n\n2', 'Table of Contents\n\nteams. We believe this focus helps our employees grow as leaders and well-rounded individuals, and better positions Netflix to operate our global business of providing compelling content to entertain the world.\n\nWe aim to generally pay our employees at the top of their personal market, and they generally are able to choose the form of their compensation between cash and stock options. This permits employee compensation to be highly personalized and reflective of each employee\'s individual needs and preferences. We conduct pay equity analyses at least annually, and have adopted practices to help ensure that employees from underrepresented groups are not being underpaid based on gender (globally) and race (U.S.) relative to others doing the same or similar work under comparable circumstances. We aim to rectify any pay gaps that we find through this analysis.\n\nWe care about the health and well-being of our employees and their families and provide a variety of benefit programs based on region, including health benefits. In the U.S., employees generally receive an annual cash health benefit allowance that they may allocate to medical, dental and vision premiums in a way that makes sense for them. Employees have access to a host of other benefits, including mental health, childcare, family planning and a company match for charitable donations.\n\nWe believe that our approach to human capital resources has been instrumental in our growth, and has made Netflix a desirable destination for employees.\n\nOTHER INFORMATION\n\nWe maintain a website at www.netflix.com. The contents of our website are not incorporated in, or otherwise to be regarded as part of, this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We make available, free of charge on our website, access to our Annual Report on Form 10-K, our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, our Current Reports on Form 8-K and amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), as soon as reasonably practicable after we file or furnish them electronically with the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC").\n\nInvestors and others should note that we announce material financial and other information to our investors using our investor relations website (ir.netflix.net), SEC filings, press releases, public conference calls and webcasts. We use these channels as well as social media and blogs to communicate with our members and the public about our company, our services and other issues. It is possible that the information we post on social media and blogs could be deemed to be material information. Therefore, we encourage investors, the media, and others interested in our company to review the information we post on the social media channels and blogs listed on our investor relations website.\n\n3', 'Table of Contents\n\nItem 1A.Risk Factors\n\nIf any of the following risks actually occur, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be harmed. In that case, the trading price of our common stock could decline, and you could lose all or part of your investment.\n\nRisks Related to Our Business\n\nIf our efforts to attract and retain members are not successful, our business will be adversely affected.\n\nWe must continually add new members both to replace canceled memberships and to grow our business beyond our current membership base. Our penetration and growth rates have fluctuated and vary across the jurisdictions where we provide our service. In countries where we have been operating for many years or where we are highly penetrated, our membership growth is slower than in newer or less penetrated countries. Our ability to continue to attract and retain members will depend in part on our ability to consistently provide our members in countries around the globe with compelling content choices that keep our members engaged with our service, effectively drive conversation around our content and service, as well as provide a quality experience for choosing and enjoying TV series, films and games. Furthermore, the relative service levels, content offerings, pricing and related features of competitors to our service may adversely impact our ability to attract and retain members. Competitors include other entertainment video providers, such as linear television, and streaming entertainment providers (including those that provide pirated content), video gaming providers, as well as user-generated content, and more broadly other sources of entertainment that our members could choose in their moments of free time.\n\nMembers cancel our service for many reasons, including a perception that they do not use the service sufficiently, that they need to cut household expenses, dissatisfaction with content, a preference for competitive services and customer service issues that they believe are not satisfactorily resolved. Membership growth is also impacted by seasonality, with the fourth quarter historically representing our greatest growth, as well as the timing of our content release schedules. Adverse macroeconomic conditions, including inflation, may also adversely impact our ability to attract and retain members. If we do not grow as expected, given, in particular, that our content costs are largely fixed in nature, we may not be able to adjust our expenditures or increase our (per membership) revenues, including by adjusting membership pricing, commensurate with the lowered growth rate such that our margins, liquidity and results of operations may be adversely impacted. If we are unable to successfully compete with current and new competitors in providing compelling content, retaining our existing members and attracting new members, our business will be adversely affected.\n\nIf we do not continuously provide value to our members, including making improvements to our service in a manner that is favorably received by them, our revenue, results of operations and business will be adversely affected.\n\nIf consumers do not perceive our service offering to be of value, including if we introduce new or adjust existing features, adjust pricing or service offerings, or change the mix of content in a manner that is not favorably received by them, we may not be able to attract and retain members, and accordingly, our revenue, including revenue per paying membership, and results of operations may be adversely affected. We have recently expanded our entertainment video offering to include games. If our efforts to develop and offer games are not valued by our current and future members, our ability to attract and retain members may be negatively impacted. We may also seek to extend our business into new products and services to help drive growth. For example, we are expanding our offering of consumer products and live experiences. To the extent we cannot successfully find and develop new products and services to help drive growth, our future results of operations and growth may be adversely impacted.\n\nWe have and may, from time to time, adjust our membership pricing, our membership plans, or our pricing model itself. For example, we introduced a new, lower-priced ad-supported subscription plan. Similarly, we have increased enforcement of and will continue to enforce our terms of use to limit multi-household usage and shared viewing outside of a household. These and other adjustments we make may not be well-received by consumers, and could negatively impact our ability to attract and retain members, revenues per paying membership, revenue and our results of operations. In addition, many of our members rejoin our service or originate from word-of-mouth advertising from existing members. If our efforts to satisfy our existing members or adjustments to our service are not successful, we may not be able to attract or retain members, and as a result, our ability to maintain and/or grow our business will be adversely affected.\n\nChanges in competitive offerings for entertainment video could adversely impact our business.\n\nThe market for entertainment is intensely competitive and subject to rapid change. Through new and existing distribution channels, consumers have increasing options to access entertainment video. The various economic models underlying these channels include subscription, transactional, ad-supported and piracy-based models. All of these have the potential to capture\n\n4', 'Table of Contents\n\nmeaningful segments of the entertainment video market. Traditional providers of entertainment video, including broadcasters and cable network operators, as well as internet based e-commerce or entertainment video providers are increasing their streaming video offerings. Several of these competitors have long operating histories, large customer bases, strong brand recognition, exclusive rights to certain content, large content libraries, and significant financial, marketing and other resources. They may offer more compelling content or secure better terms from suppliers, adopt more aggressive pricing and devote more resources to product development, technology, infrastructure, content acquisitions and marketing. New entrants may enter the market or existing providers may adjust their services with unique offerings or approaches to providing entertainment video. In addition, new technological developments, including the development and use of generative artificial intelligence, are rapidly evolving. If our competitors gain an advantage by using such technologies, our ability to compete effectively and our results of operations could be adversely impacted. Companies also may enter into business combinations or alliances that strengthen their competitive positions. Piracy also threatens to damage our business, as its fundamental proposition to consumers is so compelling and difficult to compete against: virtually all content for free. In light of the compelling consumer proposition, piracy services are subject to rapid global growth, and our efforts to prevent that growth may be insufficient. If we are unable to successfully or profitably compete with current and new competitors, our business will be adversely affected, and we may not be able to increase or maintain market share, revenues or profitability.\n\nWe face risks, such as unforeseen costs and potential liability in connection with content we acquire, produce, license and/or distribute through our service.\n\nAs a producer and distributor of content, we face potential liability for negligence, copyright and trademark infringement, or other claims based on the nature and content of materials that we acquire, produce, license and/or distribute. We also may face potential liability for content used in promoting our service, including marketing materials. We devote significant resources toward the development, production, marketing and distribution of original programming, including TV series, documentaries, feature films and games. We believe that original and exclusive programming can help differentiate our service from other offerings, enhance our brand and otherwise attract and retain members. To the extent our programming does not meet our expectations, in particular, in terms of costs, viewing and popularity, our business, including our brand and results of operations may be adversely impacted. As a content producer, we are responsible for production costs and other expenses, such as ongoing guild payments, and take on risks associated with production, such as completion and key talent risk. Further, negotiations or renewals related to entertainment industry collective bargaining agreements have, and in the future, could negatively impact timing and costs associated with our productions. We contract with third parties related to the development, production, marketing and distribution of our original programming. We may face potential liability or may suffer significant losses in connection with these arrangements, including but not limited to if such third parties violate applicable law, become insolvent or engage in fraudulent behavior. To the extent we create and sell physical or digital merchandise relating to our programming, and/or license such rights to third parties, we could become subject to product liability, intellectual property or other claims related to such merchandise. We may decide to remove content from our service, not to place licensed or produced content on our service or discontinue or alter production of original content if we believe such content might not be well received by our members, is prohibited by law, or could be damaging to our brand or business.\n\nTo the extent we do not accurately anticipate costs or mitigate risks, including for content that we obtain but ultimately does not appear on or is removed from our service, or if we become liable for content we acquire, produce, license and/or distribute, our business may suffer. Litigation to defend these claims could be costly and the expenses and damages arising from any liability or unforeseen production risks could harm our results of operations. We may not be indemnified against claims or costs of these types and we may not have insurance coverage for these types of claims.\n\nIf we are not able to manage change and growth, our business could be adversely affected.\n\nWe are expanding our operations internationally, scaling our streaming service to effectively and reliably handle anticipated growth in both members and features related to our services, such as introducing games and advertising on our service, as well as offering live programming and expanding our consumer products and experiences. We are also scaling our own studio operations to produce original content, including through acquisitions such as Scanline and Animal Logic. As our international offering evolves, we are managing and adjusting our business to address varied content offerings, consumer customs and practices, in particular those dealing with e-commerce and streaming video, as well as differing legal and regulatory environments. As we scale our streaming service and introduce new features such as our new ad-supported subscription plan, we are developing technology and utilizing third-party “cloud” computing, technology and other services. As we scale our content production, including games, and introduce new features, such as live programming and expand our consumer products and experience offerings, we are building out expertise in a number of disciplines, including creative, marketing, legal, finance, licensing, merchandising and other resources, which requires significant resources and management attention. Further, we may expand our content and service offerings in a manner that is not well received by consumers. As we grow our operations, we may face integration and operational challenges as well as potential unknown liabilities and reputational concerns in connection with partners we work with or companies we may acquire or control. If we are not able to\n\n5', "Table of Contents\n\nmanage the growing complexity of our business, including improving, refining or revising our corporate culture, as well as our systems and operational practices related to our streaming operations and original content, our business may be adversely affected.\n\nIf we fail to maintain a positive reputation concerning our service and the content we offer, we may not be able to attract or retain members, we may face regulatory scrutiny and our operating results may be adversely affected.\n\nWe believe that a positive reputation concerning our service is important in attracting and retaining members. To the extent our content, in particular, our original programming, is perceived as low quality, offensive or otherwise not compelling to consumers, our ability to establish and maintain a positive reputation may be adversely impacted. To the extent our content is deemed controversial or offensive by government regulators, we may face direct or indirect retaliatory action or behavior, including being required to remove such content from our service, our entire service could be banned and/or become subject to heightened regulatory scrutiny across our business and operations. We could also face boycotts which could adversely affect our business. Furthermore, to the extent our response to government action or our marketing, customer service and public relations efforts are not effective or result in negative reaction, our ability to establish and maintain a positive reputation may likewise be adversely impacted. There is an increasing focus from regulators, investors, members and other stakeholders on environmental, social, and governance (“ESG”) matters, both in the United States and internationally, including the adoption of new disclosure and regulatory frameworks. To the extent the content we distribute and the manner in which we produce content creates ESG related concerns, our reputation may be harmed.\n\nOur business could be adversely impacted by costs and challenges associated with strategic acquisitions and investments.\n\nFrom time to time, we acquire or invest in businesses, content, and technologies that support our business. The risks associated with such acquisitions or investments (some of which may be unforeseen) include the difficulty of integrating solutions, operations, and personnel; inheriting liabilities and exposure to litigation; failure to realize anticipated benefits and expected synergies; and diversion of management’s time and attention, among other acquisition-related risks.\n\nWe may not be successful in overcoming such risks, and such acquisitions and investments may negatively impact our business. In addition, if we do not complete an announced acquisition transaction or integrate an acquired business successfully and in a timely manner, we may not realize the benefits of the acquisition to the extent anticipated. Acquisitions and investments may contribute to fluctuations in our quarterly financial results. These fluctuations could arise from transaction-related costs and charges associated with eliminating redundant expenses or write-offs of impaired assets recorded in connection with acquisitions and investments, and could negatively impact our financial results.\n\nWe rely upon a number of partners to make our service available on their devices.\n\nWe currently offer members the ability to receive streaming content through a host of internet-connected devices, including TVs, digital video players, TV set-top boxes and mobile devices. We have agreements with various cable, satellite and telecommunications operators to make our service available through the TV set-top boxes of these service providers, some of which compete directly with us or have investments in competing streaming content providers. In many instances, our agreements also include provisions by which the partner bills consumers directly for the Netflix service or otherwise offers services or products in connection with offering our service. If partners or other providers do a better job of connecting consumers with content they want to watch, for example through multi-service discovery interfaces, our service may be adversely impacted. We intend to continue to broaden our relationships with existing partners and to increase our capability to stream TV series and films and offer games to other platforms and partners over time. If we are not successful in maintaining existing and creating new relationships, or if we encounter technological, content licensing, regulatory, business or other impediments to delivering our streaming content to our members via these devices, our ability to retain members and grow our business could be adversely impacted.\n\nOur agreements with our partners are typically between one and three years in duration and our business could be adversely affected if, upon expiration, a number of our partners do not continue to provide access to our service or are unwilling to do so on terms acceptable to us, which terms may include the degree of accessibility and prominence of our service. Furthermore, devices are manufactured and sold by entities other than Netflix and while these entities should be responsible for the devices’ performance, the connection between these devices and our service may nonetheless result in consumer dissatisfaction toward us and such dissatisfaction could result in claims against us or otherwise adversely impact our business. In addition, technology changes to our streaming functionality may require that partners update their devices, or may lead to us to stop supporting the delivery of our service on certain legacy devices. If partners do not update or otherwise modify their devices, or if we discontinue support for certain devices, our service and our members' use and enjoyment could be negatively impacted.\n\n6", "Table of Contents\n\nWe are subject to payment processing risk.\n\nOur members pay for our service using a variety of different payment methods, including credit and debit cards, gift cards, prepaid cards, direct debit, online wallets and direct carrier and partner billing. We rely on internal systems and those of third parties to process payment. Acceptance and processing of these payment methods are subject to certain rules, regulations, and industry standards, including data storage requirements, additional authentication requirements for certain payment methods, and require payment of interchange and other fees. To the extent there are increases in payment processing fees, material changes in the payment ecosystem, such as large re-issuances of payment cards, delays in receiving payments from payment processors, changes to rules, regulations or industry standards concerning payments, loss of payment partners and/or disruptions or failures in our payment processing systems, partner systems or payment products, including products we use to update payment information, our revenue, operating expenses and results of operations could be adversely impacted. In certain instances, we leverage third parties such as our cable and other partners to bill subscribers on our behalf. If these third parties become unwilling or unable to continue processing payments on our behalf, we would have to transition subscribers or otherwise find alternative methods of collecting payments, which could adversely impact member acquisition and retention. In addition, from time to time, we encounter fraudulent use of payment methods, which could impact our results of operations and if not adequately controlled and managed could create negative consumer perceptions of our service. If we are unable to maintain our fraud and chargeback rate at acceptable levels, card networks may impose fines, our card approval rate may be impacted and we may be subject to additional card authentication requirements. The termination of our ability to process payments on any major payment method would significantly impair our ability to operate our business.\n\nIf government regulations relating to the internet or other areas of our business change, we may need to alter the manner in which we conduct our business, or incur greater operating expenses.\n\nThe adoption or modification of laws or regulations relating to the internet or other areas of our business could limit or otherwise adversely affect the manner in which we currently conduct our business. As our service and others like us gain traction in international markets, governments are increasingly looking to introduce new or extend legacy regulations to these services, in particular those related to broadcast media and tax. For example, European law enables individual member states to impose levies and other financial obligations on media operators located outside their jurisdiction. Several jurisdictions have and others may, over time, impose financial and regulatory obligations on us. In addition, the continued growth and development of the market for online commerce may lead to more stringent consumer protection laws, which may impose additional burdens on us. If we are required to comply with new regulations or legislation or new interpretations of existing regulations or legislation, this compliance could cause us to incur additional expenses or alter our business model.\n\nChanges in laws or regulations that adversely affect the growth, popularity or use of the internet, including laws impacting net neutrality or requiring payment of network access fees, could decrease the demand for our service and increase our cost of doing business. Certain laws intended to prevent network operators from discriminating against the legal traffic that traverse their networks have been implemented in many countries, including across the European Union. In others, the laws may be nascent or non-existent. Furthermore, favorable laws may change, including for example, in the United States where net neutrality regulations were repealed. Given uncertainty around these rules, including changing interpretations, amendments or repeal, coupled with potentially significant political and economic power of local network operators, we could experience discriminatory or anti-competitive practices that could impede our growth, cause us to incur additional expense or otherwise negatively affect our business.\n\nWe are engaged in legal proceedings that could cause us to incur unforeseen expenses and could occupy a significant amount of our management's time and attention.\n\nFrom time to time, we are subject to litigation or claims that could negatively affect our business operations and financial position. As we have grown, we have seen a rise in the number of litigation matters against us. These matters have included copyright and other claims related to our content, patent infringement claims, tax litigation, employment related litigation, as well as consumer and securities class actions, each of which are typically expensive to defend. Litigation disputes could cause us to incur unforeseen expenses, result in content unavailability, service disruptions, and otherwise occupy a significant amount of our management's time and attention, any of which could negatively affect our business operations and financial position. We also receive inquiries and subpoenas and other types of information requests from government authorities, and we may become subject to related claims and other actions related to our business activities. While the ultimate outcome of investigations, inquiries, information requests and related legal proceedings is difficult to predict, such matters can be expensive, time-consuming and distracting, and adverse resolutions or settlements of those matters may result in, among other things, modification of our business practices, reputational harm or costs and significant payments, any of which could negatively affect our business operations and financial position.\n\nOur advertising offering is new and subject to various risks and uncertainties, which may adversely affect our business.\n\n7", 'Table of Contents\n\nWe have limited experience and operating history offering advertising on our service, and our advertising revenue may not grow as we expect. Our ability to generate advertising revenue is subject to various risks and will depend on a number of factors, including:\n\n•our ability to attract and retain advertisers;\n\n•fluctuations in memberships, including those selecting the ad-supported subscription plan, and member engagement;\n\n•the quantity or quality of ads shown to our members;\n\n•our ability to compete effectively for advertising spend;\n\n•the impact of seasonal, cyclical or other shifts in advertising spend, including the impact of macroeconomic conditions;\n\n•the availability, accuracy, utility, and security of analytics and measurement solutions offered by us or third parties that demonstrate the value of our ads to marketers, or our ability to further improve such tools;\n\n•changes in the way advertising on devices, connected TVs or on personal computers is measured or priced;\n\n•adverse legal developments relating to advertising or measurement tools;\n\n•changes in third-party policies, which may negatively impact the ability to measure, deliver and select ads to be served;\n\n•regulatory, legislative and industry developments relating to the collection and use of information and other privacy considerations, including regulations related to ad targeting and measurement tools;\n\n•any liability or reputational harm from advertisements shown on our service;\n\n•our relationship with third-party service providers for the management, operation, sale and technology to support advertisements on our service;\n\n•our ability to develop and expand an advertising sales organization team;\n\n•our ability to develop the technology and related infrastructure to support advertising;\n\n•the impact of our content and reputation on advertisers’ willingness to spend with us; and\n\n•any member dissatisfaction due to advertisements.\n\nRisks Related to Intellectual Property\n\nIf studios, content providers or other rights holders refuse to license streaming content or other rights upon terms acceptable to us, our business could be adversely affected.\n\nOur ability to provide our members with content they can enjoy depends on obtaining various rights from third parties upon terms acceptable to us, including necessary distribution rights, to such content and certain related elements thereof, such as the public performance of music contained within the content we distribute. The license periods and the terms and conditions of such rights vary. As content providers develop their own streaming services, they may be unwilling to provide us with access to certain content, including popular series or movies. If the studios, content providers and other rights holders are not or are no longer willing or able to license us content upon terms acceptable to us, our ability to stream content to our members may be adversely affected and/or our costs could increase. Certain licenses for content provide for the studios or other content providers to withdraw content from our service relatively quickly. Because of these provisions and other actions we may take, content available through our service can be withdrawn on short notice. As competition increases, we see the cost of certain programming increase. As we seek to differentiate our service, we are often focused on securing certain exclusive rights when obtaining content, including original content. We are also focused on programming an overall mix of content that delights our members in a cost efficient manner. Within this context, we are selective about the titles we add and renew to our service. If we do not maintain a compelling mix of content, our member acquisition and retention may be adversely affected.\n\nMusic and certain authors’ performances contained within content we distribute may require us to obtain licenses for such distribution. In this regard, we engage in negotiations with collection management organizations (“CMOs”) and similar entities that hold certain rights to music and/or other interests in intellectual property (e.g., remuneration rights) in connection with streaming content into various territories. If we are unable to reach mutually acceptable terms with these organizations, we could become involved in litigation and/or could be enjoined from distributing certain content, which could adversely impact our business. Additionally, pending and ongoing litigation and negotiations between certain CMOs and other third parties in various territories could adversely impact our negotiations with CMOs, or result in music publishers represented by certain CMOs unilaterally withdrawing rights, and thereby adversely impact our ability to reach licensing agreements reasonably acceptable to us. Failure to reach such licensing agreements could expose us to potential liability for copyright infringement or otherwise increase our costs. Additionally, as the market for the digital distribution of content grows, a broader role for CMOs in the remuneration of authors, performers and other beneficiaries of neighboring rights is likely to expose us to greater distribution expenses in certain markets.\n\n8', 'Table of Contents\n\nIf our trademarks and other proprietary rights are not adequately protected to prevent use or appropriation by third parties, the value of our brand and other intangible assets may be diminished, and our business may be adversely affected.\n\nWe rely and expect to continue to rely on a combination of confidentiality and license agreements with our employees, consultants and third parties with whom we have relationships, as well as trademark, copyright, patent and trade secret protection laws, to protect our proprietary rights. We may also seek to enforce our proprietary rights through court proceedings or other legal actions. We have filed and we expect to file from time to time for trademark, copyright, and patent applications. Nevertheless, these applications may not be approved, third parties may challenge any copyrights, patents or trademarks issued to or held by us, third parties may knowingly or unknowingly infringe our intellectual property rights, and we may not be able to prevent infringement or misappropriation without substantial expense to us. If the protection of our intellectual property rights is inadequate to prevent use or misappropriation by third parties, the value of our brand, content, and other intangible assets may be diminished, competitors may be able to more effectively mimic our service and methods of operations, the perception of our business and service to members and potential members may become confused in the marketplace, and our ability to attract members may be adversely affected.\n\nWe currently hold various domain names relating to our brand, including Netflix.com. Failure to protect our domain names could adversely affect our reputation and brand and make it more difficult for users to find our website and our service. We may be unable, without significant cost or at all, to prevent third parties from acquiring domain names that are similar to, infringe upon or otherwise decrease the value of our trademarks and other proprietary rights.\n\nIntellectual property claims against us could be costly and result in the loss of significant rights related to, among other things, our website, streaming technology, our recommendation and merchandising technology, title selection processes, our content, and marketing activities.\n\nTrademark, copyright, patent and other intellectual property rights are important to us and other companies. Our intellectual property rights extend to our technology, business processes, the content we produce and distribute through our service, and consumer products, experiences, and marketing assets based thereon. We use the intellectual property of third parties in creating some of our content, merchandising our products and marketing our service. From time to time, third parties allege that we have infringed or otherwise violated their intellectual property rights. If we are unable to obtain sufficient rights, successfully defend our use, or develop non-infringing technology or otherwise alter our business practices on a timely basis in response to claims against us for infringement, misappropriation, misuse or other violation of third-party intellectual property rights, our business and competitive position may be adversely affected. In addition, the use or adoption of new and emerging technologies may increase our exposure to intellectual property claims, and the availability of copyright and other intellectual property protection for AI-generated material is uncertain. Many companies are devoting significant resources to developing patents that could potentially affect many aspects of our business. There are numerous patents that broadly claim means and methods of conducting business on the internet. We have not searched patents relative to our technology. Defending ourselves against intellectual property claims, whether they are with or without merit or are determined in our favor, results in costly litigation and diversion of technical and management personnel. It also may result in our inability to use our current website, streaming technology, our recommendation and merchandising technology or inability to market our service or merchandise our products. We may also have to remove content from our service, or remove consumer products or marketing materials from the marketplace. As a result of a dispute, we may have to develop non-infringing technology, enter into royalty or licensing agreements, adjust our content, merchandising or marketing activities or take other actions to resolve the claims. These actions, if required, may be costly or unavailable on terms acceptable to us.\n\nRisks Related to Information Technology\n\nAny significant disruption in or unauthorized access to our computer systems or those of third parties that we utilize in our operations, including those relating to cybersecurity or arising from cyber-attacks, could result in a loss or degradation of service, unauthorized access, disclosure or destruction of data, including member and corporate information, or theft of intellectual property, including digital content assets, which could adversely impact our business.\n\nOur reputation and ability to attract, retain and serve our members is dependent upon the reliable performance and security of our computer systems and those of third parties that we utilize in our operations. These systems may be subject to damage or interruption from, among other things, earthquakes, adverse weather conditions, other natural disasters, public health issues such as pandemics or epidemics, terrorist attacks, rogue employees, power loss, telecommunications failures, cybersecurity risks and incidents, and other interruptions beyond our control. Interruptions in these systems, or with the internet in general, could make our service unavailable or degraded or otherwise hinder our ability to deliver our service. Service interruptions, errors in our software or the unavailability of computer systems or data used in our operations could diminish the overall attractiveness of our service to existing and potential members.\n\n9', 'Table of Contents\n\nOur computer systems and those of third parties we use in our operations are subject to constantly evolving cybersecurity threats, including cyber-attacks such as computer viruses, malware, ransomware, denial of service attacks, physical or electronic break-ins, or insider threats, as well as misconfigurations in information systems, networks, software or hardware, and similar disruptions or errors. These systems periodically experience directed attacks intended to lead to interruptions and delays in our service and operations as well as loss, misuse or theft of personal information (of third parties, employees, and our members) and other data, confidential information or intellectual property. We and many of the third parties we work with rely on open source software and libraries that are integrated into a variety of applications, tools and systems, which may increase our exposure to vulnerabilities. Additionally, outside parties may attempt to induce employees, vendors, partners, or users to disclose sensitive or confidential information in order to gain access to data. Any attempt by hackers to obtain our data (including member and corporate information) or intellectual property (including digital content assets), disrupt our service, or otherwise access our systems, or those of third parties we use, if successful, could harm our business, be expensive to remedy and damage our reputation. We have implemented certain systems and processes to thwart hackers and protect our data and systems. However, the techniques used to gain unauthorized access to data and software are constantly evolving, and we may be unable to anticipate, detect or prevent unauthorized access or address all cybersecurity incidents that occur. Because of our prominence, we (and/or third parties we use) have been and may continue to be a particularly attractive target for such attacks, and from time to time, we have experienced an unauthorized release of certain digital content assets. However, to date these unauthorized releases have not had a material impact on our service, systems or business. There is no assurance that hackers may not have a material impact on our service or systems in the future. We do not carry insurance to cover expenses related to such disruptions or unauthorized access. Efforts to prevent hackers from disrupting our service or otherwise accessing our systems are expensive to develop, implement and maintain. These efforts require ongoing monitoring and updating as technologies change and efforts to overcome security measures become more sophisticated, and may limit the functionality of or otherwise negatively impact our service offering and systems. Any significant disruption to our service or access to our systems could result in a loss of members and adversely affect our business and results of operation. Further, a penetration of our systems or a third-party’s systems or other misappropriation or misuse of personal information could subject us to business, regulatory, litigation and reputation risk, which could have a negative effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\nWe utilize our own communications and computer hardware systems located either in our facilities or in that of a third-party provider. In addition, we utilize third-party “cloud” computing services in connection with our business operations. We also utilize our own and third-party content delivery networks to help us stream TV series, documentaries and feature films and offer games in high volume to Netflix members over the internet. Problems faced by us or our third-party “cloud” computing or other network providers, including technological or business-related disruptions, as well as cybersecurity threats and regulatory interference, could adversely impact the experience of our members.\n\nWe rely upon Amazon Web Services to operate certain aspects of our service and any disruption of or interference with our use of the Amazon Web Services operation would impact our operations and our business would be adversely impacted.\n\nAmazon Web Services (“AWS”) provides a distributed computing infrastructure platform for business operations, or what is commonly referred to as a "cloud" computing service. We have architected our software and computer systems so as to utilize data processing, storage capabilities and other services provided by AWS. Currently, we run the vast majority of our computing on AWS. Given this, along with the fact that we cannot easily switch our AWS operations to another cloud provider, any disruption of or interference with our use of AWS would impact our operations and our business would be adversely impacted. While the retail side of Amazon competes with us, we do not believe that Amazon will use the AWS operation in such a manner as to gain competitive advantage against our service, although if it were to do so it could harm our business.\n\nIf the technology we use in operating our business fails, is unavailable, or does not operate to expectations, our business and results of operations could be adversely impacted.\n\nWe utilize a combination of proprietary and third-party technology to operate our business. This includes the technology that we have developed to recommend and merchandise content to our consumers as well as enable fast and efficient delivery of content to our members and their various consumer electronic devices. For example, we have built and deployed our own content-delivery network (“CDN”). To the extent Internet Service Providers (“ISPs”) do not interconnect with our CDN or charge us to access their networks, or if we experience difficulties in our CDN’s operation, our ability to efficiently and effectively deliver our streaming content to our members could be adversely impacted and our business and results of operations could be adversely affected. Likewise, if our recommendation and merchandising technology does not enable us to predict and recommend titles that our members will enjoy, our ability to attract and retain members may be adversely affected. We also utilize third-party technology to help market our service, process payments, and otherwise manage the daily operations of our business. If our technology or that of third-parties we utilize in our operations fails or otherwise operates improperly,\n\n10', 'Table of Contents\n\nincluding as a result of “bugs” or other errors in our development and deployment of software, our ability to operate our service, retain existing members and add new members may be impaired. Any harm to our members’ devices caused by software used in our operations could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\n\nChanges in how network operators handle and charge for access to data that travel across their networks could adversely impact our business.\n\nWe rely upon the ability of consumers to access our service through the internet. If network operators block, restrict or otherwise impair access to our service over their networks, our service and business could be negatively affected. To the extent that network operators implement usage based pricing, including meaningful bandwidth caps, or otherwise try to monetize access to their networks by data providers, we could incur greater operating expenses and our member acquisition and retention could be negatively impacted. Furthermore, to the extent network operators create tiers of internet access service and either charge us for or prohibit us from being available through these tiers, our business could be negatively impacted.\n\nMost network operators that provide consumers with access to the internet also provide these consumers with multichannel video programming. As such, many network operators have an incentive to use their network infrastructure in a manner adverse to our continued growth and success. While we believe that consumer demand, regulatory oversight and competition will help check these incentives, to the extent that network operators are able to provide preferential treatment to their data as opposed to ours or otherwise implement discriminatory network management practices, our business could be negatively impacted. The extent to which these incentives limit operator behavior differs across markets.\n\nRisks Related to Privacy\n\nPrivacy concerns could limit our ability to collect and leverage member personal information and disclosure of member personal information could adversely impact our business and reputation.\n\nIn the ordinary course of business and in particular in connection with content acquisition, merchandising our service to our members and our ad-supported subscription plan, we collect and utilize information supplied by our members, which may include personal information and other data. We are subject to laws, rules and regulations in the U.S. and in other countries relating to privacy and the collection, use and security of personal information, including but not limited to Regulation (EU) 2016/679 (also known as the General Data Protection Regulation or “GDPR”) and the California Privacy Rights Act ("CPRA"). Any actual or perceived failure to comply with the GDPR, the California Consumer Privacy Act/CPRA, other data privacy laws or regulations, or related contractual or other obligations, or any perceived privacy rights violation, could lead to investigations, claims, and proceedings by governmental entities and private parties, damages for contract breach, and other significant costs, penalties, and other liabilities, as well as harm to our reputation and market position.\n\nOther businesses have been criticized by privacy groups and governmental bodies for attempts to link personal identities and other information to data collected on the internet regarding users’ browsing and other habits. Increased regulation of data utilization practices, including self-regulation or findings under existing laws that limit our ability to collect, transfer and use personal information, could have an adverse effect on our business. In addition, if we were to disclose personal information about our members in a manner that was objectionable to them, our business reputation could be adversely affected, and we could face potential legal claims that could impact our operating results. Internationally, we may become subject to additional and/or more stringent legal obligations concerning our treatment of member and other personal information, such as laws regarding data localization and/or restrictions on data export. Failure to comply with these obligations could subject us to liability, and to the extent that we need to alter our business model or practices to adapt to these obligations, we could incur additional expenses.\n\nOur reputation and relationships with members would be harmed if member personal information, particularly billing data, were to be accessed by unauthorized persons.\n\nWe maintain personal information regarding our members, including names, age, gender and billing information. This personal information is maintained on our own systems as well as that of third parties we use in our operations. With respect to billing information, such as credit card numbers, we rely on encryption and authentication technology to secure such information. We take measures to protect against unauthorized intrusion into our members’ information. Despite these measures and technologies we, our payment processing services or other third-party services we use such as AWS, could experience an unauthorized intrusion into our members’ information. In the event of such a breach, current and potential members may become unwilling to provide the information to us necessary for them to remain or become members. We also may be required to notify regulators about any actual or perceived data breach (including various state Attorneys General, one or more EU data protection authorities, or other data protection authorities) as well as the individuals who are affected by the incident within strict time periods. Additionally, we could face legal claims or regulatory fines or penalties for such a breach. The costs relating to any data breach could be material, and we currently do not carry insurance against the risk of a data\n\n11', 'Table of Contents\n\nbreach. We also maintain personal information concerning our employees, as well as personal information of others working on our productions. Should an unauthorized intrusion into our members’ or employees’ personal information and/or production personal information occur, our business could be adversely affected and our larger reputation with respect to data protection could be negatively impacted.\n\nRisks Related to Liquidity\n\nThe long-term and largely fixed cost nature of our content commitments may limit our operating flexibility and could adversely affect our liquidity and results of operations.\n\nIn connection with licensing streaming content, we typically enter into multi-year commitments with studios and other content providers. We also enter into multi-year commitments for content that we produce, either directly or through third parties, including elements associated with these productions such as non-cancelable commitments under talent agreements. The payment terms of these agreements are not tied to member usage or the size of our membership base (“fixed cost”) but may be determined by costs of production or tied to such factors as titles licensed and/or theatrical exhibition receipts. Such commitments, to the extent estimable under accounting standards, are included in the Contractual Obligations section of Part II, Item 7, "Management\'s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" and Note 8, Commitments and Contingencies in the accompanying notes to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8, "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Given the multiple-year duration and largely fixed cost nature of content commitments, if business performance does not meet our expectations, our margins may be adversely impacted. Further, we may be unable to react to any reduction in our cash flows from operations, including those caused by a downturn in the economy, by reducing our streaming content obligations in the near-term. Payment terms for certain content commitments, such as content we directly produce, will typically require more up-front cash payments than other content licenses or arrangements whereby we do not fund the production of such content. To the extent membership and/or revenue growth do not meet our expectations, our liquidity and results of operations could be adversely affected as a result of content commitments and accelerated payment requirements of certain agreements. In addition, the long-term and largely fixed cost nature of our content commitments may limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to changes in our business and the market segments in which we operate. If we license and/or produce content that is not favorably received by consumers in a territory, or is unable to be shown in a territory, acquisition and retention may be adversely impacted and given the long-term and fixed cost nature of our content commitments, we may not be able to adjust our content offerings quickly and our results of operations may be adversely impacted.\n\nWe may seek additional capital that may result in stockholder dilution or that may have rights senior to those of our common stockholders.\n\nFrom time to time, we may seek to obtain additional capital, either through equity, equity-linked or debt securities. For several years prior to 2020, our cash flows from operations were negative and to the extent that it becomes negative in the future we may need to seek additional capital. The decision to obtain additional capital will depend on, among other things, our business plans, operating performance and condition of the capital markets. Rising interest rates or any disruption in the capital markets could make it more difficult and expensive for us to raise additional capital or refinance our existing indebtedness. If we raise additional funds through the issuance of equity, equity-linked or debt securities, those securities may have rights, preferences or privileges senior to the rights of our common stock, and our stockholders may experience dilution. Any large equity or equity-linked offering could also negatively impact our stock price.\n\nWe have a substantial amount of indebtedness and other obligations, including streaming content obligations, which could adversely affect our financial position, and we may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service our debt and other obligations.\n\nWe have a substantial amount of indebtedness and other obligations, including streaming content obligations. Moreover, we may incur additional indebtedness in the future and incur other obligations, including additional streaming content obligations. Our ability to make payments on our debt and other obligations will depend on our financial and operating performance, which is subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions and to certain financial, business and other factors beyond our control. If we are unable to service our debt and other obligations from cash flows, we may need to refinance or restructure all or a portion of such obligations prior to maturity. If the financial markets become difficult or costly to access, including due to rising interest rates, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates or other changes in economic conditions, our ability to raise additional capital may be negatively impacted, and any refinancing or restructuring could be at higher interest rates and may require us to comply with more onerous covenants, which could further restrict our business operations. As of December\xa031, 2023, we had the equivalent of $14.6 billion aggregate principal amount of senior notes outstanding (“Notes”), some of which is denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. In addition, we have entered into a revolving credit agreement that provides for a $1 billion unsecured revolving credit facility. As of December\xa031, 2023, we\n\n12', 'Table of Contents\n\nhave not borrowed any amount under this revolving credit facility. As of December\xa031, 2023, we had approximately $7.0 billion of total content liabilities as reflected on our consolidated balance sheet, some of which is denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Such amount does not include streaming content commitments that do not meet the criteria for liability recognition, the amounts of which are significant. For more information on our streaming content obligations, including those not on our consolidated balance sheet, see Note 8, Commitments and Contingencies in the accompanying notes to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8, "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Our substantial indebtedness and other obligations, including streaming content obligations, may:\n\n•make it difficult for us to satisfy our financial obligations, including making scheduled principal and interest payments on our Notes and our other obligations;\n\n•limit our ability to borrow additional funds, if needed, for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions or other general business purposes;\n\n•increase our cost of borrowing;\n\n•limit our ability to use our cash flow or obtain additional financing for future working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions or other general business purposes;\n\n•require us to use a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to make debt service payments and pay our other obligations when due;\n\n•limit our flexibility to plan for, or react to, changes in our business and industry;\n\n•place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our less leveraged competitors; and\n\n•increase our vulnerability to the impact of adverse economic and industry conditions, including changes in interest rates and foreign exchange rates.\n\nRisks Related to International Operations\n\nWe could be subject to economic, political, regulatory and other risks arising from our international operations.\n\nOperating in international markets requires significant resources and management attention and will subject us to economic, political, regulatory and other risks that may be different from or incremental to those in the U.S. In addition to the risks that we face in the U.S., our international operations involve risks that could adversely affect our business, including:\n\n•the need to adapt our content and user interfaces for specific cultural and language differences;\n\n•difficulties and costs associated with staffing and managing foreign operations;\n\n•political or social unrest, global hostilities, and economic instability;\n\n•compliance with laws such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, UK Bribery Act and other anti-corruption laws, export controls and economic sanctions, and local laws prohibiting corrupt payments to government officials;\n\n•difficulties in understanding and complying with local laws, regulations and customs in foreign jurisdictions, including local ownership requirements for streaming content providers;\n\n•regulatory requirements or government action against our service, whether in response to enforcement of actual or purported legal and regulatory requirements or otherwise, that results in disruption or non-availability of our service or particular content or increased operating costs in the applicable jurisdiction;\n\n•foreign intellectual property laws, such as the EU copyright directive, or changes to such laws, among other issues, may impact the economics of creating or distributing content, anti-piracy efforts, or our ability to protect or exploit intellectual property rights;\n\n•adverse tax consequences such as those related to changes in tax laws or tax rates or their interpretations, and the related application of judgment in determining our global provision for income taxes, deferred tax assets or liabilities or other tax liabilities given the ultimate tax determination is uncertain;\n\n•fluctuations in currency exchange rates, which have and may continue to impact revenues and expenses of our international operations and expose us to foreign currency exchange rate risk, and while we use derivative instruments to hedge certain exposures to fluctuations in exchange rates, the use of such hedging activities may not be effective in offsetting an adverse financial impact and may introduce or heighten counterparty risk;\n\n•rates of inflation;\n\n•profit repatriation, currency control regulations and other restrictions on the transfer of funds;\n\n•differing payment processing systems as well as consumer use and acceptance of electronic payment methods, such as payment cards;\n\n•new and different sources of competition;\n\n13', 'Table of Contents\n\n•censorship requirements that cause us to remove or edit popular content, leading to consumer disappointment, brand tarnishment or dissatisfaction with our service;\n\n•low usage and/or penetration of internet-connected consumer electronic devices;\n\n•different and more stringent user protection, data protection, privacy and other laws, including data localization and/or restrictions on data export, and local ownership requirements;\n\n•availability of reliable broadband connectivity and wide area networks in targeted areas for expansion;\n\n•differing laws and consumer understanding/attitudes regarding the illegality of piracy;\n\n•negative impacts from trade disputes; and\n\n•implementation of regulations designed to stimulate the local production of film and TV series in order to promote and preserve local culture and economic activity, including local content quotas, investment obligations, and levies to support local film funds. For example, the European Union revised its Audio Visual Media Services Directive in 2018 to require that European works comprise at least thirty percent (30%) of media service providers’ catalogs, and to require prominence of those works.\n\nThese and other factors may cause us to adjust our business plans, including expanding or ceasing certain operations in certain countries, and the execution of our strategies. Our failure to manage any of these risks successfully could harm our international operations and our overall business, and results of our operations.\n\nWe are subject to taxation related risks in multiple jurisdictions.\n\nWe are a U.S.-based multinational company subject to tax in multiple U.S. and foreign tax jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in determining our global provision for income taxes, deferred taxes and other tax liabilities and receivables, and in evaluating our tax positions and other tax attributes on a worldwide basis. We are subject to the periodic examination of our domestic and foreign tax returns by the IRS, state, local, and foreign tax authorities, some of whom are challenging our tax positions. We regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes from these examinations in determining the adequacy of our provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities. We consider many factors when evaluating and estimating our tax positions and tax benefits, which may require periodic adjustments and may not accurately forecast actual tax audit outcomes. If the ultimate determination of income and other tax liabilities differ from the amounts recorded or accrued, our business, financial condition or results of operations may be adversely impacted.\n\nTax laws are regularly being re-examined and evaluated globally. New laws and interpretations of the law are taken into account for financial statement purposes in the quarter or year that they become applicable. Tax authorities are increasingly scrutinizing the tax positions of companies and we have tax audits pending in several jurisdictions. The U.S. federal and state governments, countries in the European Union, as well as a number of other countries and organizations such as the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, are actively considering changes to existing tax laws that, if enacted, could increase our tax obligations in jurisdictions where we do business. If U.S. or other tax authorities change applicable tax laws or successfully challenge how or where our profits are currently recognized, our overall taxes could increase, and our business, financial condition or results of operations may be adversely impacted.\n\nRisks Related to Human Resources\n\nWe may lose key employees or may be unable to hire qualified employees, and the failure to maintain and improve our company culture may adversely affect our business.\n\nWe rely on the continued service of our senior management, including our Co-Chief Executive Officers, Ted Sarandos and Greg Peters, our Executive Chairman, Reed Hastings, members of our executive team and other key employees. In our industry, there is substantial and continuous competition for highly-skilled business, product development, technical, creative and other personnel. If we experience high executive turnover, fail to adapt our business practices to industry expectations, fail to implement succession plans for key employees, encounter difficulties associated with the transition of members of our management team, are not successful in recruiting new personnel or in retaining and motivating existing personnel, in instilling our culture in new employees, or maintaining and improving our culture as we grow, our operations may be disrupted, which could adversely affect our results of operations.\n\nLabor disputes may have an adverse effect on the Company’s business.\n\nWe and our partners, suppliers, and vendors engage writers, directors, actors, other talent, trade employees and others who are subject to collective bargaining agreements in the motion picture industry, both in the U.S. and internationally. Expiring collective bargaining agreements may be renewed on terms that are unfavorable to us. If expiring collective bargaining agreements cannot be renewed, affected unions have, and could in the future, take action in the form of strikes or work stoppages. For example, the Writers Guild (“WGA”) and Screen Actors Guild (“SAG-AFTRA”) collective bargaining\n\n14', 'Table of Contents\n\nagreements expired in 2023, and WGA members and the SAG-AFTRA members went on strike in May 2023 and July 2023, respectively. Collective bargaining agreements with the I.A.T.S.E. representing technicians and “behind the camera” crews as well as contracts with Teamster unions expire in mid-2024. The WGA and SAG-AFTRA strikes as well as the recent resurgence of organized labor in the United States may lead those workers to strike. Such work stoppages have resulted, and may in the future result, in halted productions and delays in our ability to provide new content to our members. Such actions, as well as higher costs or operating complexities in connection with these collective bargaining agreements or a significant labor dispute, could have an adverse effect on our business by causing delays in production, added costs or by reducing profit margins, and our ability to provide new content to our members could likewise be delayed or dropped.\n\nRisks Related to Our Stock Ownership\n\nProvisions in our charter documents and under Delaware law could discourage a takeover that stockholders may consider favorable, although we have announced plans to modify some of these provisions over time.\n\nOur charter documents in their current form may discourage, delay or prevent a merger or acquisition that a stockholder may consider favorable because they:\n\n•authorize our board of directors, without stockholder approval, to issue up to 10,000,000 shares of undesignated preferred stock;\n\n•provide for a classified board of directors until our annual meeting of stockholders held in 2025;\n\n•prohibit our stockholders from acting by written consent; and\n\n•establish advance notice requirements for proposing matters to be approved by stockholders at stockholder meetings.\n\nAs a Delaware corporation, we are also subject to certain Delaware anti-takeover provisions. Under Delaware law, a corporation may not engage in a business combination with any holder of 15% or more of its capital stock unless the holder has held the stock for three years or, among other things, the board of directors has approved the transaction. Our board of directors could rely on Delaware law to prevent or delay an acquisition of us.\n\nIn addition, a merger or acquisition may trigger retention payments to certain executive employees under the terms of our Amended and Restated Executive Severance and Retention Incentive Plan, thereby increasing the cost of such a transaction.\n\nOur stock price is volatile.\n\nThe price at which our common stock has traded has fluctuated significantly. The price may continue to be volatile due to a number of factors including the following, some of which are beyond our control:\n\n•variations in our operating results, including our membership acquisition and retention, revenues, operating income, net income, net cash provided by operating activities and free cash flow;\n\n•variations between our actual operating results and the expectations of securities analysts, investors and the financial community;\n\n•announcements of developments affecting our business, systems or expansion plans by us or others;\n\n•competition, including the introduction of new competitors, their pricing strategies and services;\n\n•market volatility in general;\n\n•the level of demand for our stock, including the amount of short interest in our stock;\n\n•the impact of our current stock repurchase program and any future stock repurchase program we may adopt;\n\n•the operating results of our competitors; and\n\n•other risks and uncertainties described in these risk factors.\n\nAs a result of these and other factors, investors in our common stock may not be able to resell their shares at or above their original purchase price.\n\nFollowing certain periods of volatility in the market price of our securities, we became the subject of securities litigation. We may experience more such litigation following future periods of volatility. This type of litigation may result in substantial costs and a diversion of management’s attention and resources.\n\nPreparing and forecasting our financial results requires us to make judgments and estimates which may differ materially from actual results.\n\n15', 'Table of Contents\n\nGiven the dynamic nature of our business, and the inherent limitations in predicting the future, forecasts of our revenues, operating margins, net income and other financial and operating data may differ materially from actual results. Also, predicting consumer adoption of various pricing strategies, such as the ad-supported subscription plan or efforts to limit multi-household usage, and new revenue streams, such as advertising revenue, is inherently difficult given the lack of operating history with respect to such offerings, and actual results may differ significantly from the expectations of our management, securities analysts or investors. Such discrepancies could cause a decline in the trading price of our common stock. In addition, the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America also requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported periods. We base such estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, but actual results may differ from these estimates. For example, we estimate the content amortization pattern, beginning with the month of first availability, of any particular licensed or produced television series, documentary or feature film based upon various factors including historical and estimated viewing patterns. If actual viewing patterns differ from these estimates, the pattern and/or period of amortization would be changed and could affect the timing or recognition of content amortization. If we revise such estimates it could result in greater in-period expenses, which could cause us to miss our earnings guidance or negatively impact the results we report which could negatively impact our stock price. Further, events outside of our control may cause actual results to differ from our forecast.\n\nItem 1B.Unresolved Staff Comments\n\nNone.\n\nItem 1C.Cybersecurity\n\nWe have an enterprise-wide information security program designed to identify, protect, detect and respond to and manage reasonably foreseeable cybersecurity risks and threats. To protect our information systems from cybersecurity threats, we use various security tools that help prevent, identify, escalate, investigate, resolve and recover from identified vulnerabilities and security incidents in a timely manner. These include, but are not limited to, internal reporting, monitoring and detection tools, and a bug bounty program to allow security researchers to assist us in identifying vulnerabilities in our products before they are exploited by malicious threat actors. We also maintain a third party security program to identify, prioritize, assess, mitigate and remediate third party risks; however, we rely on the third parties we use to implement security programs commensurate with their risk, and we cannot ensure in all circumstances that their efforts will be successful.\n\nWe regularly assess risks from cybersecurity and technology threats and monitor our information systems for potential vulnerabilities. We use a widely-adopted risk quantification model to identify, measure and prioritize cybersecurity and technology risks and develop related security controls and safeguards. We conduct regular reviews and tests of our information security program and also leverage audits by our internal audit team, tabletop exercises, penetration and vulnerability testing, red team exercises, simulations, and other exercises to evaluate the effectiveness of our information security program and improve our security measures and planning. We also engage an external auditor to conduct an annual payment card industry data security standard review of our security controls protecting payment information, as well as third-party penetration testing of our cardholder environment and related systems. The results of these assessments are reported to the Audit Committee.\n\nOur systems periodically experience directed attacks intended to lead to interruptions and delays in our service and operations as well as loss, misuse or theft of personal information (of third parties, employees, and our members) and other data, confidential information or intellectual property, and we have experienced an unauthorized release of certain digital content assets. However, to date these incidents have not had a material impact on our service, systems or business. Any significant disruption to our service or access to our systems could result in a loss of members and adversely affect our business and results of operation. Further, a penetration of our systems or a third-party’s systems or other misappropriation or misuse of personal information could subject us to business, regulatory, litigation and reputation risk, which could have a negative effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. See "Risk Factors - Any significant disruption in or unauthorized access to our computer systems or those of third parties that we utilize in our operations, including those relating to cybersecurity or arising from cyber-attacks, could result in a loss or degradation of service, unauthorized access, disclosure or destruction of data, including member and corporate information, or theft of intellectual property, including digital content assets, which could adversely impact our business."\n\nThe Vice President of Security and Privacy Engineering leads our global information security organization responsible for overseeing the Netflix information security program.

Team members who support our information security program have relevant educational and industry experience,\n\n16', 'Table of Contents\n\nincluding holding similar positions at large technology companies. The teams provide regular reports to senior management and other relevant teams on various cybersecurity threats, assessments and findings.\n\nThe Board oversees our annual enterprise risk assessment, where we assess key risks within the company, including security and technology risks and cybersecurity threats.

service following sign-up and a method of payment being provided, and that is not part of a free trial or certain other promotions that may be offered by the Company to new or rejoining members. Certain members have the option to add extra member sub accounts. These extra member sub accounts are not included in paid memberships. A membership is canceled and ceases to be reflected in the above metrics as of the effective cancellation date. Voluntary cancellations generally become effective at the end of the prepaid membership period. Involuntary cancellations, as a result of a failed method of payment, become effective immediately. Memberships are assigned to territories based on the geographic location used at time of sign-up as determined by the Company’s internal systems, which utilize industry standard geo-location technology.\n\n(2) We believe the non-GAAP financial measure of constant currency revenue is useful in analyzing the underlying trends in average monthly revenue per paying membership absent foreign currency fluctuations. However, this non-GAAP financial measure should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, or superior to other financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. In order to exclude the effect of foreign currency rate fluctuations on average monthly revenue per paying membership, we estimate current period revenue assuming foreign exchange rates had remained constant with foreign exchange rates from each of the corresponding months of the prior-year period. For the year ended December\xa031, 2023, our revenues would have been approximately $597\xa0million higher had foreign currency exchange rates remained constant with those for the year ended December\xa031, 2022.\n\nCost of Revenues\n\nAmortization of content assets makes up the majority of cost of revenues. Expenses directly associated with the acquisition, licensing and production of content (such as payroll, stock-based compensation, facilities, and other related personnel expenses, costs associated with obtaining rights to music included in our content, overall deals with talent, miscellaneous production related costs and participations and residuals), streaming delivery costs and other operations costs make up the remainder of cost of revenues. We have built our own global content delivery network (“Open Connect”) to help us efficiently stream a high volume of content to our members over the internet. Delivery expenses, therefore, include equipment costs related to Open Connect, payroll and related personnel expenses and all third-party costs, such as cloud computing costs, associated with delivering content over the internet. Other operations costs include customer service and payment processing fees, including those we pay to our integrated payment partners, as well as other costs directly incurred in making our content available to members.\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|  | | |  | | | Year Ended December 31, | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |  | | | Change | | | | | | | | |\n|  | | |  | | | 2023 | | |  | | | 2022 | | |  | | | 2021 | | |  | | | 2023 vs. 2022 | | | | | | | | |\n|  | | |  | | | (in\xa0thousands,\xa0except\xa0percentages) | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |\n| Cost of revenues | | |  | | | $ | 19,715,368 |  |  | | | $ | 19,168,285 |  |  | | | $ | 17,332,683 |  |  | | | $ | 547,083 |  |  | | | 3 | | % |\n| As a percentage of revenues | | |  | | | 58 | | % |  | | | 61 | | % |  | | | 58 | | % |  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |\n\nThe increase in cost of revenues for the year ended December\xa031, 2023 as compared to the year ended December\xa031, 2022 was due to a $171\xa0million increase in content amortization relating to our existing and new content, coupled with a $376\xa0million increase in other cost of revenues primarily due to an increase in expenses directly associated with the acquisition, licensing and production of content.\n\nMarketing\n\nMarketing expenses consist primarily of advertising expenses and certain payments made to our marketing and advertising sales partners, including consumer electronics ("CE") manufacturers, multichannel video programming distributors ("MVPDs"), mobile operators and ISPs.

Interest expense for the year ended December\xa031, 2023 as compared to the year ended December\xa031, 2022 remained relatively flat.\n\nInterest and Other Income (Expense)\n\nInterest and other income (expense) consists primarily of foreign exchange gains and losses on foreign currency denominated balances and interest earned on cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments.\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|  | | |  | | | Year Ended December 31, | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |  | | | Change | | | | | | | | |\n|  | | |  | | | 2023 | | |  | | | 2022 | | |  | | | 2021 | | |  | | | 2023 vs. 2022 | | | | | | | | |\n|  | | |  | | | (in thousands, except percentages) | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |\n| Interest and other income (expense) | | |  | | | $ | (48,772) |  |  | | | $ | 337,310 |  |  | | | $ | 411,214 |  |  | | | $ | (386,082) |  |  | | | (114) | | % |\n| As a percentage of revenues | | |  | | | — | | % |  | | | 1 | | % |  | | | 1 | | % |  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |\n\nInterest and other income (expense) decreased primarily due to foreign exchange losses of $293 million for the year ended December\xa031, 2023 as compared to a gain of $282\xa0million for the year ended December\xa031, 2022. The foreign exchange loss in the year ended December\xa031, 2023 was primarily driven by the non-cash loss of $176 million from the remeasurement of our Senior Notes denominated in euros, coupled with the remeasurement of cash and content liability positions in currencies other than the functional currencies. The foreign exchange gain in the year ended December\xa031, 2022 was primarily driven by the non-cash $353\xa0million gain from the remeasurement of our Senior Notes denominated in euros, partially offset by the remeasurement of cash and content liability positions in currencies other than the functional currencies. The change in foreign currency gains and losses was partially offset by a $221\xa0million increase in interest income earned due to higher average interest rates and investment balances for the year ended December\xa031, 2023 as compared to the year ended December\xa031, 2022.\n\nProvision for Income Taxes\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|  | | |  | | | Year Ended December\xa031, | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |  | | | Change | | | | | | | | |\n|  | | |  | | | 2023 | | |  | | | 2022 | | |  | | | 2021 | | |  | | | 2023 vs. 2022 | | | | | | | | |\n|  | | |  | | | (in thousands, except percentages) | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |\n| Provision for income taxes | | |  | | | $ | 797,415 |  |  | | | $ | 772,005 |  |  | | | $ | 723,875 |  |  | | | $ | 25,410 |  |  | | | 3 | | % |\n| Effective tax rate | | |  | | | 13 | | % |  | | | 15 | | % |  | | | 12 | | % |  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |\n\nThe decrease in our effective tax rate for the year ended December\xa031, 2023 as compared to the year ended December\xa031, 2022 is primarily due to a decrease in foreign taxes.

The amount of principal and interest due in the next twelve months is $1,077\xa0million. The amount of principal and interest due beyond the next twelve months is $16,662\xa0million. As of\xa0December\xa031, 2023, no amounts had been borrowed under our $1 billion Revolving Credit Agreement. See Note 6 Debt in the accompanying notes to our consolidated financial statements.\n\nWe anticipate that our future capital needs from the debt market will be more limited compared to prior years. Our ability to obtain this or any additional financing that we may choose or need, including for potential strategic acquisitions and investments, will depend on, among other things, our development efforts, business plans, operating performance, and the condition of the capital markets at the time we seek financing. We may not be able to obtain such financing on terms acceptable to us or at all. If we raise additional funds through the issuance of equity or debt securities, those securities may have rights, preferences or privileges senior to the rights of our common stock, and our stockholders may experience dilution.\n\nIn March 2021, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $5\xa0billion of our common stock, with no expiration date, and in September 2023, the Board of Directors increased the share repurchase authorization by an additional $10\xa0billion, also with no expiration date. Stock repurchases may be effected through open market repurchases in compliance with Rule 10b-18 under the Exchange Act, including through the use of trading plans intended to qualify under Rule 10b5-1 under the Exchange Act, privately-negotiated transactions, accelerated stock repurchase plans, block purchases, or other similar purchase techniques and in such amounts as management deems appropriate. We are not obligated to repurchase any specific number of shares, and the timing and actual number of shares repurchased will depend on a variety of factors, including our stock price, general economic, business and market conditions, and alternative investment opportunities. We may discontinue any repurchases of our common stock at any time without prior notice. In the fiscal year ended December\xa031, 2023, the Company repurchased 14,513,790 shares of common stock for an aggregate amount of $6,045\xa0million. As of December\xa031, 2023, $8.4\xa0billion remains available for repurchases.\n\nOur primary uses of cash include the acquisition, licensing and production of content, marketing programs, streaming delivery and personnel-related costs, as well as strategic acquisitions and investments. Cash payment terms for non-original content have historically been in line with the amortization period. Investments in original content, and in particular content that we produce and own, require more cash upfront relative to licensed content. For example, production costs are paid as the content is created, well in advance of when the content is available on the service and amortized. We expect to continue to significantly invest in global content, particularly in original content, which will impact our liquidity. We currently anticipate that cash flows from operations, available funds and access to financing sources, including our revolving credit facility, will continue to be sufficient to meet our cash needs for the next twelve months and beyond.\n\nOur material cash requirements from known contractual and other obligations primarily relate to our content, debt and lease obligations. As of December 31, 2023, the expected timing of those payments are as follows:\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| Contractual obligations (in thousands): | | |  | | | Total | | |  | | | Next 12 Months | | |  | | | Beyond 12 Months | | |\n| Content\xa0obligations\xa0(1) | | |  | | | $ | 21,713,349 |  |  | | | $ | 10,328,923 |  |  | | | $ | 11,384,426 |  |\n| Debt (2) | | |  | | | 17,739,159 | |  |  | | | 1,077,261 | |  |  | | | 16,661,898 | |  |\n| Operating lease obligations (3) | | |  | | | 3,088,899 | |  |  | | | 513,506 | |  |  | | | 2,575,393 | |  |\n| Total | | |  | | | $ | 42,541,407 |  |  | | | $ | 11,919,690 |  |  | | | $ | 30,621,717 |  |\n\n(1)As of December\xa031, 2023, content obligations were comprised of $4.5 billion included in "Current content liabilities" and $2.6 billion of "Non-current content liabilities" on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and $14.6 billion of obligations that are not reflected on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as they did not then meet the criteria for recognition.\n\n26', 'Table of Contents\n\nContent obligations include amounts related to the acquisition, licensing and production of content. An obligation for the production of content includes non-cancelable commitments under creative talent and employment agreements and other production related commitments. An obligation for the acquisition and licensing of content is incurred at the time we enter into an agreement to obtain future titles. Once a title becomes available, a content liability is recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Certain agreements include the obligation to license rights for unknown future titles, the ultimate quantity and/or fees for which are not yet determinable as of the reporting date. Traditional film output deals, or certain TV series license agreements where the number of seasons to be aired is unknown, are examples of these types of agreements. The contractual obligations table above does not include any estimated obligation for the unknown future titles, payment for which could range from less than one year to more than five years. However, these unknown obligations are expected to be significant and we believe could include approximately $1 billion to $4 billion over the next three years, with the payments for the vast majority of such amounts expected to occur after the next twelve months. The foregoing range is based on considerable management judgments and the actual amounts may differ. Once we know the title that we will receive and the license fees, we include the amount in the contractual obligations table above.\n\n(2)Debt obligations include our Notes consisting of principal and interest payments. See Note 6 Debt in the accompanying notes to our consolidated financial statements for further details.\n\n(3)Operating lease obligations are comprised of operating lease liabilities included in "Accrued expenses and other liabilities" and "Other non-current liabilities" on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, inclusive of imputed interest. Operating lease obligations also include additional obligations that are not reflected on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as they did not meet the criteria for recognition. As of December\xa031, 2023, the Company has additional operating leases for real estate that have not yet commenced of $343\xa0million which has been included above. See Note 5 Balance Sheet Components in the accompanying notes to our consolidated financial statements for further details regarding leases.\n\nIn addition, as of December\xa031, 2023, we had gross unrecognized tax benefits of $327 million, of which $221 million was classified in “Other non-current liabilities" in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. At this time, an estimate of the range of reasonably possible adjustments to the balance of unrecognized tax benefits cannot be made.\n\nFree Cash Flow\n\nWe define free cash flow as cash provided by (used in) operating activities less purchases of property and equipment and change in other assets. We believe free cash flow is an important liquidity metric because it measures, during a given period, the amount of cash generated that is available to repay debt obligations, make strategic acquisitions and investments and for certain other activities like stock repurchases. Free cash flow is considered a non-GAAP financial measure and should not be considered in isolation of, or as a substitute for, net income, operating income, net cash provided by operating activities, or any other measure of financial performance or liquidity presented in accordance with GAAP.\n\nIn assessing liquidity in relation to our results of operations, we compare free cash flow to net income, noting that the major recurring differences are the timing impact between content payments and amortization, non-cash stock-based compensation expense, non-cash remeasurement gain/loss on our euro-denominated debt, excess property and equipment purchases over depreciation, and other working capital differences. Working capital differences primarily include deferred revenue, taxes and semi-annual interest payments on our outstanding debt. Our receivables from members generally settle quickly.\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|  | | | Year Ended December\xa031, | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |  | | | Change | | | | | |\n|  | | | 2023 | | |  | | | 2022 | | |  | | | 2021 | | |  | | | 2023 vs. 2022 | | | | | |\n|  | | | (in thousands) | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |\n| Net cash provided by operating activities | | | $ | 7,274,301 |  |  | | | $ | 2,026,257 |  |  | | | $ | 392,610 |  |  | | | $ | 5,248,044 |  | 259 | | % |\n| Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities | | | 541,751 | |  |  | | | (2,076,392) | |  |  | | | (1,339,853) | |  |  | | | 2,618,143 | |  | 126 | | % |\n| Net cash used in financing activities | | | (5,950,803) | |  |  | | | (664,254) | |  |  | | | (1,149,776) | |  |  | | | 5,286,549 | |  | 796 | | % |\n|  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |\n| Non-GAAP reconciliation of free cash flow: | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |\n| Net cash provided by operating activities | | | 7,274,301 | |  |  | | | 2,026,257 | |  |  | | | 392,610 | |  |  | | | 5,248,044 | |  | 259 | | % |\n| Purchases of property and equipment | | | (348,552) | |  |  | | | (407,729) | |  |  | | | (524,585) | |  |  | | | (59,177) | |  | (15) | | % |\n| Change in other assets | | | — | |  |  | | | — | |  |  | | | (26,919) | |  |  | | | — | |  | — | | % |\n| Free cash flow | | | $ | 6,925,749 |  |  | | | $ | 1,618,528 |  |  | | | $ | (158,894) |  |  | | | $ | 5,307,221 |  | 328 | | % |\n\n27', 'Table of Contents\n\nNet cash provided by operating activities increased $5,248 million from the year ended December\xa031, 2022 to $7,274 million for the year ended December\xa031, 2023. The increase in net cash provided by operating activities was primarily driven by a decrease in payments for content assets, coupled with a $916 million or 20% increase in net income and favorable changes in working capital. The payments for content assets decreased $3,519 million, from $16,660 million to $13,140 million, or 21%.\n\nNet cash provided by (used in) investing activities increased $2,618 million from the year ended December\xa031, 2022 to $542 million for the year ended December\xa031, 2023. The increase in net cash provided by (used in) investing activities is primarily due to proceeds from the maturities of short-term investments, net of purchases, and there being no acquisitions in the year ended December\xa031, 2023, as compared to acquisitions for an aggregate amount of $757\xa0million in the year ended December\xa031, 2022.\n\nNet cash used in financing activities increased $5,287 million from the year ended December\xa031, 2022 to $5,951 million for the year ended December\xa031, 2023. The increase in net cash used in financing activities is primarily due to repurchases of common stock for an aggregate amount of $6,045\xa0million in the year ended December\xa031, 2023, as compared to no repurchases of common stock in the year ended December\xa031, 2022, partially offset by the absence of debt maturities in the year ended December\xa031, 2023 as compared to the repayment upon maturity of the $700\xa0million aggregate principal amount of our 5.500% Senior Notes in February 2022.\n\nFree cash flow was $1,518 million higher than net income for the year ended December\xa031, 2023 primarily due to $1,057 million of amortization expense exceeding cash payments for content assets, $339 million of non-cash stock-based compensation expense, $176 million of non-cash remeasurement loss on our euro-denominated debt, and $47\xa0million in other favorable working capital differences, partially offset by $101\xa0million of property and equipment purchases exceeding depreciation expense.\n\nIndemnifications\n\nThe information set forth under Note 8 Commitments and Contingencies in the accompanying notes to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8, "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K is incorporated herein by reference.\n\nCritical Accounting Estimates\n\nThe preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported periods. The Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") has defined a company’s critical accounting policies as the ones that are most important to the portrayal of a company’s financial condition and results of operations, and which require a company to make its most difficult and subjective judgments. Based on this definition, we have identified the critical accounting policies and judgments addressed below. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates.\n\nContent\n\nWe acquire, license and produce content, including original programming, in order to offer our members unlimited viewing of video entertainment. The content licenses are for a fixed fee and specific windows of availability. Payment terms for certain content licenses and the production of content require more upfront cash payments relative to the amortization expense. Payments for content, including additions to content assets and the changes in related liabilities, are classified within "Net cash provided by operating activities" on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.\n\nWe recognize content assets (licensed and produced) as "Content assets, net" on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. For licensed content, we capitalize the fee per title and record a corresponding liability at the gross amount of the liability when the license period begins, the cost of the title is known and the title is accepted and available for streaming. For produced content, we capitalize costs associated with the production, including development costs, direct costs and production overhead. Participations and residuals are expensed in line with the amortization of production costs.\n\nBased on factors including historical and estimated viewing patterns, we amortize the content assets (licensed and produced) in “Cost of revenues” on the Consolidated Statements of Operations over the shorter of each title\'s contractual window of availability or estimated period of use or ten years, beginning with the month of first availability. The amortization is on an accelerated basis, as we typically expect more upfront viewing, and film amortization is more accelerated than TV series amortization. On average, over 90% of a licensed or produced content asset is expected to be amortized within four years\n\n28', 'Table of Contents\n\nafter its month of first availability. We review factors that impact the amortization of the content assets on a regular basis. Our estimates related to these factors require considerable management judgment.\n\nIn the normal course of business, we, or a third-party producing content on our behalf, may qualify for tax incentives through eligible spend on productions. The accounting for tax incentives is dependent on the particular type of incentive, including the nature of the benefit and the location the incentive is earned. In general, tax incentives are realized as cash receipts and may be received prior to or after a title launches on our service. Upon a title’s launch, any amounts we are eligible for through qualified production spend but have not received, are recognized in “Other current assets” or “Other non-current assets” on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as receivables. Tax incentives are generally accounted for as a reduction to the cost basis of content assets (presented in “Content assets, net”) and reduce content amortization over the life of the title (as presented in “Cost of revenues”) on the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\n\nOur business model is subscription based as opposed to a model generating revenues at a specific title level. Content assets (licensed and produced) are predominantly monetized as a group and therefore are reviewed at a group level when an event or change in circumstances indicates a change in the expected usefulness of the content or that the fair value may be less than unamortized cost. To date, we have not identified any such event or changes in circumstances. If such changes are identified in the future, these aggregated content assets will be stated at the lower of unamortized cost or fair value. In addition, unamortized costs for assets that have been, or are expected to be, abandoned are written off.\n\nIncome Taxes\n\nWe record a provision for income taxes for the anticipated tax consequences of our reported results of operations using the asset and liability method. Deferred income taxes are recognized by applying enacted statutory tax rates applicable to future years to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases as well as net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. The measurement of deferred tax assets is reduced, if necessary, by a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not they will not be realized.\n\nAlthough we believe our assumptions, judgments and estimates are reasonable, changes in tax laws or our interpretation of tax laws and the resolution of any tax audits could significantly impact the amounts provided for income taxes in our consolidated financial statements.\n\nIn evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets, in full or in part, we consider all available positive and negative evidence, including our past operating results, and our forecast of future earnings, future taxable income and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies. The assumptions utilized in determining future taxable income require significant judgment and are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying business. Actual operating results in future years could differ from our current assumptions, judgments and estimates.\n\nWe do not recognize certain tax benefits from uncertain tax positions within the provision for income taxes. We may recognize a tax benefit only if it is more likely than not the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such positions are then measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon settlement. Due to uncertainties in any tax audit outcome, our estimates of the ultimate settlement of our unrecognized tax positions may change and the actual tax benefits may differ significantly from the estimates.\n\nSee Note 10 Income Taxes to the consolidated financial statements for further information regarding income taxes.\n\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\n\nThe information set forth under Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements under the caption “Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” is incorporated herein by reference.\n\nItem 7A.Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk\n\nWe are exposed to market risks related to interest rate changes and the corresponding changes in the market values of our debt and foreign currency fluctuations.\n\nInterest Rate Risk\n\nAt December\xa031, 2023, our cash equivalents and short-term investments were generally invested in money market funds and time deposits. Interest paid on such funds fluctuates with the prevailing interest rate.\n\nAs of December\xa031, 2023, we had $14.6 billion of debt, consisting of fixed rate unsecured debt in fourteen tranches due between 2024 and 2030. Refer to Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements for details about all issuances. The fair value\n\n29', 'Table of Contents\n\nof our debt will fluctuate with movements of interest rates, increasing in periods of declining rates of interest and declining in periods of increasing rates of interest. The fair value of our debt will also fluctuate based on changes in foreign currency rates, as discussed below.\n\nForeign Currency Risk\n\nWe operate our business globally and transact in multiple currencies. Currencies denominated in other than the U.S. dollar accounted for 57% of revenue and 28% of operating expenses for the year ended December\xa031, 2023. We therefore have foreign currency risk related to these currencies, with our largest exposures being the euro, the British pound, the Brazilian real, the Canadian dollar, and the Mexican peso.\n\nAccordingly, volatility in exchange rates, and in particular a weakening of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar may negatively affect our revenue and operating income as expressed in U.S. dollars. For the year ended December\xa031, 2023, our revenues would have been approximately $597 million higher had foreign currency exchange rates remained constant with those in the same period of 2022. See Part II, Item 7, "Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" for further information regarding our non-GAAP financial measure of constant currency.\n\nIn the year ended December\xa031, 2023, we entered into foreign exchange forward contracts to mitigate fluctuations in forecasted U.S. dollar-equivalent revenues occurring in January 2024 and beyond from changes in foreign currency exchange rates. These contracts may reduce, but do not entirely eliminate, the effect of foreign currency exchange fluctuations, and we may choose not to hedge certain exposures. We designate these contracts as cash flow hedges of forecasted foreign currency revenue and initially record the gains or losses on these derivative instruments as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (“AOCI") and reclassify the amounts into “Revenues” on the Consolidated Statements of Operations in the same period the forecasted transaction affects earnings. If the U.S dollar weakened by 10% as of December\xa031, 2023, the amount recorded in AOCI related to our foreign exchange contracts, before taxes, would have been approximately $958\xa0million lower. This adverse change in AOCI would be expected to offset a corresponding favorable foreign currency change in the underlying forecasted revenues when recognized in earnings.\n\nIn the year ended December\xa031, 2023, we also entered into foreign exchange forward contracts to mitigate fluctuations in forecasted and firmly committed U.S. dollar-equivalent transactions related to the licensing and production of content assets occurring in January 2024 and beyond from changes in foreign currency exchange rates. These contracts may reduce, but do not entirely eliminate, the effect of foreign currency exchange fluctuations, and we may choose not to hedge certain exposures. We designate these contracts as cash flow hedges and initially record the gains or losses on these derivative instruments as a component of AOCI and reclassify the amounts into “Cost of Revenues” to offset the hedged exposures as they affect earnings, which occurs as the underlying hedged content assets are amortized. If the U.S dollar strengthened by 10% as of December\xa031, 2023, the amount recorded in AOCI related to our foreign exchange contracts, before taxes, would have been approximately $71\xa0million lower. This adverse change in AOCI would be expected to offset a corresponding favorable foreign currency change in the underlying exposures when recognized in earnings.\n\nWe have also experienced and will continue to experience fluctuations in our net income as a result of gains (losses) on the settlement and the remeasurement of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies that are not the functional currency. In the year ended December\xa031, 2023, we recognized a $293\xa0million foreign exchange loss primarily due to the non-cash remeasurement of our Senior Notes denominated in euros and the remeasurement of cash and content liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currencies.\n\nIn addition, the effect of exchange rate changes on cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash as disclosed on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows in the year ended December\xa031, 2023 was an increase of $83 million.\n\nItem 8.Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\n\nThe consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes listed in Part IV, Item\xa015(a)(1) of this Annual Report on Form 10-K are included immediately following Part IV hereof and incorporated by reference herein.\n\nItem 9.Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure\n\nNone.\n\n30', 'Table of Contents\n\nItem 9A.Controls and Procedures\n\n(a)Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\n\nOur management, with the participation of our co-Chief Executive Officers and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Based on that evaluation, our co-Chief Executive Officers and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K were effective in providing reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission’s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our co-Chief Executive Officers and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures.\n\nOur management, including our co-Chief Executive Officers and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal controls will prevent all error and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within Netflix have been detected.\n\n(b)Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\n\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) of the Exchange Act). Our management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December\xa031, 2023. In making this assessment, our management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (“COSO”) in Internal Control—Integrated Framework (2013 framework). Based on our assessment under the framework in Internal Control—Integrated Framework (2013 framework), our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December\xa031, 2023. The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December\xa031, 2023 has been audited by Ernst & Young LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report that is included herein.\n\n(c)Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\n\nThere was no change in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended December\xa031, 2023 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\n\n31', 'Table of Contents\n\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\n\nTo the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of Netflix, Inc.\n\nOpinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\n\nWe have audited Netflix, Inc.’s internal control over financial reporting as of December\xa031, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). In our opinion, Netflix, Inc. (the Company) maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December\xa031, 2023, based on the COSO criteria.\n\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of December\xa031, 2023 and 2022, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, stockholders’ equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December\xa031, 2023, and the related notes and our report dated January\xa026, 2024 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.\n\nBasis for Opinion\n\nThe Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\n\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.\n\nOur audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\n\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\n\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\n\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|  | | | /s/ Ernst & Young LLP | | |\n| San Jose, California | | |  | | |\n| January 26, 2024 | | |  | | |\n\n32', 'Table of Contents\n\nItem 9B.Other Information\n\nRule 10b5-1 Trading Plans\n\nThe adoption or termination of contracts, instructions or written plans for the purchase or sale of our securities by our Section 16 officers and directors for the three months ended December 31, 2023, each of which is intended to satisfy the affirmative defense conditions of Rule 10b5-1(c) under the Exchange Act (“Rule 10b5-1 Plan”), were as follows:\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| Name | | |  | | | Title | | |  | | | Action | | |  | | | Date Adopted | | |  | | | Expiration Date | | |  | | | Aggregate # of Securities to be Purchased/Sold | | |\n| Ted Sarandos (1) | | |  | | | Co-CEO and Director | | |  | | | Adoption | | |  | | | 11/10/2023 | | |  | | | 2/7/2025 | | |  | | | 68,957 | | |\n\n|  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|  |  |  |\n| (1) Ted Sarandos, co-CEO and a member of the Board of Directors, entered into a pre-arranged stock trading plan pursuant to Rule 10b5-1 on November 10, 2023.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at December\xa031, 2023 and 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December\xa031, 2023, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.\n\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December\xa031, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework), and our report dated January\xa026, 2024 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.\n\nBasis for Opinion\n\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\n\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\n\nCritical Audit Matter\n\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective or complex judgments. The communication of the critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\n\n37', "Table of Contents\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|  | | | Content Amortization | | |\n| Description of the Matter | | | As disclosed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements “Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies”, the Company acquires, licenses and produces content, including original programming (“Content”). The Company amortizes Content based on factors including historical and estimated viewing patterns.  Auditing the amortization of the Company’s Content is complex and subjective due to the judgmental nature of amortization which is based on an estimate of future viewing patterns. Estimated viewing patterns are based on historical and forecasted viewing. If actual viewing patterns differ from these estimates, the pattern and/or period of amortization would be changed and could affect the timing of recognition of content amortization. | | |\n|  | | |  | | |\n| How We Addressed the  Matter in Our Audit | | | We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over the content amortization process. For example, we tested controls over management’s review of the content amortization method and the significant assumptions, including the historical and forecasted viewing hour consumption, used to develop estimated viewing patterns. We also tested management’s controls to determine that the data used in the model was complete and accurate.  To test content amortization, our audit procedures included, among others, evaluating the content amortization method, testing the significant assumptions used to develop the estimated viewing patterns and testing the completeness and accuracy of the underlying data. For example, we assessed management’s assumptions by comparing them to current viewing trends and current operating information including comparing previous estimates of viewing patterns to actual results. We also performed sensitivity analyses to evaluate the potential changes in the content amortization recorded that could result from changes in the assumptions. | | |\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- |

accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements.\n\n43', 'Table of Contents\n\nNETFLIX, INC.\n\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\n1.Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\n\nDescription of Business\n\nNetflix, Inc. (the “Company”) was incorporated on August\xa029, 1997 and began operations on April\xa014, 1998. The Company is one of the world’s leading entertainment services with over 260 million paid memberships in over 190 countries enjoying TV series, films and games across a wide variety of genres and languages. Members can play, pause and resume watching as much as they want, anytime, anywhere, and can change their plans at any time.\n\nBasis of Presentation\n\nThe consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. Intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated.\n\nUse of Estimates\n\nThe preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Significant items subject to such estimates and assumptions include the content asset amortization policy and the recognition and measurement of income tax assets and liabilities. The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that the Company believes to be reasonable under the circumstances. On an ongoing basis, the Company evaluates these assumptions, judgments and estimates. Actual results may differ from these estimates\n\nRecently issued accounting pronouncements not yet adopted\n\nIn November 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures, which requires public entities to disclose information about their reportable segments’ significant expenses and other segment items on an interim and annual basis. Public entities with a single reportable segment are required to apply the disclosure requirements in ASU 2023-07, as well as all existing segment disclosures and reconciliation requirements in ASC 280 on an interim and annual basis. ASU 2023-07 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, and for interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024, with early adoption permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting ASU 2023-07.\n\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures, which requires public entities, on an annual basis, to provide disclosure of specific categories in the rate reconciliation, as well as disclosure of income taxes paid disaggregated by jurisdiction. ASU 2023-09 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024, with early adoption permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting ASU 2023-09.\n\nCash Equivalents and Short-term Investments\n\nThe Company considers investments in instruments purchased with an original maturity of 90 days or less to be cash equivalents. The Company also classifies amounts in transit from payment processors for customer credit card and debit card transactions that it expects to settle within several days as cash equivalents.\n\nThe Company classifies short-term investments, which consist of marketable securities with original maturities in excess of 90 days as available-for-sale. Short-term investments are reported at fair value, with allowances for credit losses included in “Interest and other income (expense)” in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and unrealized gains and losses included in “Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)” within Stockholders’ equity in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Company uses the specific identification method to determine cost in calculating realized gains and losses upon the sale of short-term investments.\n\nShort-term investments are reviewed periodically for allowances for credit losses and impairment. When evaluating the investments, the Company reviews factors such as the extent to which the fair value of the security is less than the amortized cost basis, adverse conditions specifically related to the security, the financial condition of the issuer, the Company’s intent to sell, and whether it would be more likely than not that the Company would be required to sell the investments before the recovery of their amortized cost basis.\n\n44', 'Table of Contents\n\nContent\n\nThe Company acquires, licenses and produces content, including original programming, in order to offer members unlimited viewing of video entertainment. The content licenses are for a fixed fee and specific windows of availability. Payment terms for certain content licenses and the production of content require more upfront cash payments relative to the amortization expense. Payments for content, including additions to content assets and the changes in related liabilities, are classified within "Net cash provided by operating activities" on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.\n\nThe Company recognizes content assets (licensed and produced) as “Content assets, net” on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. For licensed content, the Company capitalizes the fee per title and records a corresponding liability at the gross amount of the liability when the license period begins, the cost of the title is known and the title is accepted and available for streaming. For produced content, the Company capitalizes costs associated with the production, including development costs, direct costs and production overhead. Participations and residuals are expensed in line with the amortization of production costs.\n\nBased on factors including historical and estimated viewing patterns, the Company amortizes the content assets (licensed and produced) in “Cost of revenues” on the Consolidated Statements of Operations over the shorter of each title\'s contractual window of availability or estimated period of use or ten years, beginning with the month of first availability. The amortization is on an accelerated basis, as the Company typically expects more upfront viewing, and film amortization is more accelerated than TV series amortization. On average, over 90% of a licensed or produced content asset is expected to be amortized within four years after its month of first availability. The Company reviews factors impacting the amortization of the content assets on a regular basis. The Company\'s estimates related to these factors require considerable management judgment.\n\nIn the normal course of business, the Company, or a third-party producing content on the Company\'s behalf, may qualify for tax incentives through eligible spend on productions. The accounting for tax incentives is dependent on the particular type of incentive, including the nature of the benefit and the location the incentive is earned. In general, tax incentives are realized as cash receipts and may be received prior to or after a title launches on the Company’s service. Upon a title’s launch, any amounts the Company is eligible for through qualified production spend but has not received, are recognized in “Other current assets” or “Other non-current assets” on the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets as receivables. Tax incentives are generally accounted for as a reduction to the cost basis of the Company’s content assets (presented in “Content assets, net”) and reduce content amortization over the life of the title (as presented in “Cost of revenues”) on the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\n\nThe Company\'s business model is subscription based as opposed to a model generating revenues at a specific title level. Content assets (licensed and produced) are predominantly monetized as a group and therefore are reviewed in aggregate at a group level when an event or change in circumstances indicates a change in the expected usefulness of the content or that the fair value may be less than unamortized cost. To date, the Company has not identified any such event or changes in circumstances. If such changes are identified in the future, these aggregated content assets will be stated at the lower of unamortized cost or fair value. In addition, unamortized costs for assets that have been, or are expected to be, abandoned are written off.\n\nAcquisitions\n\nThe Company uses its best estimates and assumptions to assign fair value to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date. In addition, uncertain tax positions, tax-related valuation allowances and pre-acquisition contingencies are initially recorded in connection with a business combination as of the acquisition date.\n\nProperty and Equipment\n\nProperty and equipment are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method over the shorter of the estimated useful lives of the respective assets, generally up to 30 years, or the expected lease term for leasehold improvements, if applicable.\n\nTrade Receivables\n\nTrade receivables consist primarily of amounts related to members and payment partners that collect membership fees on the Company\'s behalf. The Company evaluates the need for an allowance for credit losses based on historical collection trends, the financial condition of its payment partners, and external market factors. The Company\'s allowance for credit losses was not material as of December\xa031, 2023 and December\xa031, 2022.\n\nRevenue Recognition\n\nThe Company\'s primary source of revenues is from monthly membership fees. Members are billed in advance of the start of their monthly membership and revenues are recognized ratably over each monthly membership period. Revenues are\n\n45', 'Table of Contents\n\npresented net of the taxes that are collected from members and remitted to governmental authorities. The Company is the principal in all its relationships where partners, including consumer electronics ("CE") manufacturers, multichannel video programming distributors ("MVPDs"), mobile operators and internet service providers ("ISPs"), provide access to the service as the Company retains control over service delivery to its members. In circumstances in which the price that the member pays is established by a partner and there is no standalone price for the Netflix service (for instance, in a bundle), the net amount collected from the partner is recognized as revenue.\n\nThe Company also earns revenue from advertisements presented on its streaming service, consumer products and various other sources. Revenues earned from sources other than monthly membership fees were not material for the years ended December\xa031, 2023, 2022, and 2021. See Note 2 Revenue Recognition to the consolidated financial statements for further information regarding revenues.\n\nMarketing\n\nMarketing expenses consist primarily of advertising expenses and certain payments made to the Company’s partners, including CE manufacturers, MVPDs, mobile operators and ISPs. Marketing expenses also include payroll, stock-based compensation, facilities, and other related expenses for personnel that support the Company\'s sales and marketing activities. Advertising expenses include promotional activities such as digital and television advertising. Advertising costs are expensed as incurred. Advertising expenses were $1,732 million, $1,586 million and $1,669 million for the years ended December\xa031, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\n\nIncome Taxes\n\nThe Company records a provision for income taxes for the anticipated tax consequences of the reported results of operations using the asset and liability method. Deferred income taxes are recognized by applying enacted statutory tax rates applicable to future years to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases as well as net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. The measurement of deferred tax assets is reduced, if necessary, by a valuation allowance for any tax benefits for which future realization is uncertain. We account for the tax effects of global intangible low tax income as a current period expense.\n\nThe Company does not recognize certain tax benefits from uncertain tax positions within the provision for income taxes. The Company may recognize a tax benefit only if it is more likely than not the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such positions are then measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon settlement. The Company recognizes interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions in income tax expense. See Note 10 Income Taxes to the consolidated financial statements for further information regarding income taxes.\n\nForeign Currency\n\nThe functional currency for the Company\'s subsidiaries is determined based on the primary economic environment in which the subsidiary operates. The Company translates the assets and liabilities of its non-U.S. dollar functional currency subsidiaries into U.S. dollars using exchange rates in effect at the end of each period. Revenues and expenses for these subsidiaries are translated using rates that approximate those in effect during the period. Gains and losses from these translations are recognized in cumulative translation adjustment included in "Accumulated other comprehensive income" in Stockholders’ equity on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\n\nThe Company remeasures monetary assets and liabilities that are not denominated in the functional currency at exchange rates in effect at the end of each period. Gains and losses from these remeasurements are recognized in "Interest and other income (expense)" in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Foreign currency transactions resulted in a loss of $293 million, a gain of $282\xa0million, and a gain of $403\xa0million for the years ended December\xa031, 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively. These gains and losses were primarily due to the non-cash remeasurement of our Senior Notes denominated in euros and the remeasurement of cash and content liability positions denominated in currencies other than functional currencies.\n\nDerivative Financial Instruments\n\nThe Company uses derivative instruments to manage foreign exchange risk related to its ongoing business operations with the primary objective of reducing operating income and cash flow volatility associated with fluctuations in foreign exchange rates.\n\nThe Company enters into forward contracts to manage the foreign exchange risk on forecasted revenue transactions denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, as well as the foreign exchange risk on forecasted transactions and firm commitments related to the licensing and production of foreign currency-denominated content assets. These forward contracts\n\n46', 'Table of Contents\n\nare designated as cash flow hedges of foreign currency firm commitments and forecasted transactions and generally have maturities of 24 months or less. The hedging contracts may reduce, but do not entirely eliminate, the effect of foreign currency exchange movements, and the Company may choose not to hedge certain exposures.\n\nThe Company recognizes derivative instruments at fair value as either assets (presented in “Other current assets” and “Other non-current assets”) or liabilities (presented in “Accrued expenses and other liabilities\'\' and “Other non-current liabilities”) on the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Company classifies derivative instruments in the Level 2 category within the fair value hierarchy.\n\nThe gain or loss on derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges of forecasted foreign currency revenue is initially reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (“AOCI") and reclassified into “Revenues” on the Consolidated Statements of Operations in the same period the forecasted transaction affects earnings. The gain or loss on derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges of firmly committed or forecasted transactions related to the licensing and production of content assets is initially reported as a component of AOCI and reclassified into “Cost of Revenues” on the Consolidated Statements of Operations in the same period the hedged transaction affects earnings, which occurs as the underlying hedged content assets are amortized. Cash flows from hedging activities are classified in the same category as the cash flows for the underlying item being hedged within "Net cash provided by operating activities" on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.\n\nIn the event that the likelihood of occurrence of the underlying forecasted transactions is determined to be probable not to occur, the gains or losses on the related cash flow hedges are reclassified from AOCI to “Interest and other income (expense)” in the Consolidated Statements of Operations in the period of dedesignation.\n\nSee Note 7 Derivative Financial Instruments to the consolidated financial statements for further information regarding the Company’s derivative financial instruments.\n\nStock-Based Compensation\n\nThe Company grants non-qualified stock options to its employees on a monthly basis. Stock-based compensation expense is based on the fair value of the options at the grant date and is recognized, net of forfeitures, over the requisite service period. See Note 9 Stockholders\' Equity to the consolidated financial statements for further information regarding stock-based compensation.\n\n2.Revenue Recognition\n\nThe following tables summarize streaming revenues, paid net membership additions (losses), and ending paid memberships by region for the years ended December\xa031, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively:\n\nUnited States and Canada (UCAN)\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|  | | |  | | | As of/Year Ended December 31, | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |\n|  | | |  | | | 2023 | | |  | | | 2022 | | |  | | | 2021 | | |\n|  | | |  | | | (in thousands) | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |\n| Revenues | | |  | | | $ | 14,873,783 |  |  | | | $ | 14,084,643 |  |  | | | $ | 12,972,100 |  |\n| Paid net membership additions (losses) | | |  | | | 5,832 | |  |  | | | (919) | |  |  | | | 1,279 | |  |\n| Paid memberships at end of period (1) | | |  | | | 80,128 | |  |  | | | 74,296 | |  |  | | | 75,215 | |  |\n|  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |\n|  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |\n\nEurope, Middle East, and Africa (EMEA)\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|  | | |  | | | As of/Year Ended December 31, | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |\n|  | | |  | | | 2023 | | |  | | | 2022 | | |  | | | 2021 | | |\n|  | | |  | | | (in thousands) | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |\n| Revenues | | |  | | | $ | 10,556,487 |  |  | | | $ | 9,745,015 |  |  | | | $ | 9,699,819 |  |\n| Paid net membership additions | | |  | | | 12,084 | |  |  | | | 2,693 | |  |  | | | 7,338 | |  |\n| Paid memberships at end of period (1) | | |  | | | 88,813 | |  |  | | | 76,729 | |  |  | | | 74,036 | |  |\n|  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |\n|  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |\n\n47', 'Table of Contents\n\nLatin America (LATAM)\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|  | | |  | | | As of/Year Ended December 31, | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |\n|  | | |  | | | 2023 | | |  | | | 2022 | | |  | | | 2021 | | |\n|  | | |  | | | (in thousands) | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |\n| Revenues | | |  | | | $ | 4,446,461 |  |  | | | $ | 4,069,973 |  |  | | | $ | 3,576,976 |  |\n| Paid net membership additions | | |  | | | 4,298 | |  |  | | | 1,738 | |  |  | | | 2,424 | |  |\n| Paid memberships at end of period (1) | | |  | | | 45,997 | |  |  | | | 41,699 | |  |  | | | 39,961 | |  |\n|  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |\n|  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |\n\nAsia-Pacific (APAC)\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|  | | |  | | | As of/Year Ended December 31, | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |\n|  | | |  | | | 2023 | | |  | | | 2022 | | |  | | | 2021 | | |\n|  | | |  | | | (in thousands) | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |\n| Revenues | | |  | | | $ | 3,763,727 |  |  | | | $ | 3,570,221 |  |  | | | $ | 3,266,601 |  |\n| Paid net membership additions | | |  | | | 7,315 | |  |  | | | 5,391 | |  |  | | | 7,140 | |  |\n| Paid memberships at end of period (1) | | |  | | | 45,338 | |  |  | | | 38,023 | |  |  | | | 32,632 | |  |\n|  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |\n|  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |\n\n|  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|  |  |  |\n| (1) A paid membership (also referred to as a paid subscription) is defined as a membership that has the right to receive Netflix service following sign-up and a method of payment being provided, and that is not part of a free trial or certain other promotions that may be offered by the Company to new or rejoining members. Certain members have the option to add extra member sub accounts. These extra member sub accounts are not included in paid memberships. A membership is canceled and ceases to be reflected in the above metrics as of the effective cancellation date. Voluntary cancellations generally become effective at the end of the prepaid membership period. Involuntary cancellations, as a result of a failed method of payment, become effective immediately. Memberships are assigned to territories based on the geographic location used at time of sign-up as determined by the Company’s internal systems, which utilize industry standard geo-location technology. | | |\n\nDeferred revenue consists of membership fees billed that have not been recognized, as well as gift and other prepaid memberships that have not been fully redeemed. As of December 31, 2023, total deferred revenue was $1,443\xa0million, the vast majority of which was related to membership fees billed that are expected to be recognized as revenue within the next month. The remaining deferred revenue balance, which is related to gift cards and other prepaid memberships, will be recognized as revenue over the period of service after redemption, which is expected to occur over the next 12 months. The $178 million increase in deferred revenue as compared to the balance of $1,265\xa0million for the year ended December\xa031, 2022, is a result of the increase in membership fees billed due to increased memberships.\n\n48', 'Table of Contents\n\n3.Earnings per Share\n\nBasic earnings per share is computed using the weighted-average number of outstanding shares of common stock during the period. Diluted earnings per share is computed using the weighted-average number of outstanding shares of common stock and, when dilutive, potential common shares outstanding during the period. Potential common shares consist of incremental shares issuable upon the assumed exercise of stock options.

These leases generally have terms which range from 1 year to 15 years, and often include one or more options to renew. These renewal terms can extend the lease term from 1 year to 20 years, and are included in the lease term when it is reasonably certain that the Company will exercise the option. These operating leases are included in "Other non-current assets" on the Company\'s Consolidated Balance Sheets, and represent the Company’s right to use the underlying asset for the lease term. The Company’s obligations to make lease payments are included in "Accrued expenses and other liabilities" and "Other non-current liabilities" on the Company\'s Consolidated Balance Sheets. \xa0Operating lease right-of-use assets and liabilities are recognized at the commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. The Company has entered into various short-term operating leases with an initial term of twelve months or less. These leases are not recorded on the Company\'s Consolidated Balance Sheets. All operating lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Because the rate implicit in each lease is not readily determinable, the Company uses its incremental borrowing rate to determine the present value of the lease payments. The Company has certain contracts for real estate which may contain lease and non-lease components which it has elected to treat as a single lease component.\n\nThe components of lease costs for the years ended December\xa031, 2023, 2022 and 2021 were as follows:\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|  | | | Year ended December 31, | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |\n|  | | | 2023 | | |  | | | 2022 | | |  | | | 2021 | | |\n|  | | | (in thousands) | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |\n| Operating lease cost | | | $ | 430,856 |  |  | | | $ | 413,664 |  |  | | | $ | 389,805 |  |\n| Short-term lease cost | | | 207,822 | |  |  | | | 194,764 | |  |  | | | 152,765 | |  |\n| Total lease cost | | | $ | 638,678 |  |  | | | $ | 608,428 |  |  | | | $ | 542,570 |  |\n\nInformation related to the Company\'s operating right-of-use assets and related operating lease liabilities were as follows:\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|  | | | Year ended December 31, | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |\n|  | | | 2023 | | |  | | | 2022 | | |  | | | 2021 | | |\n|  | | | (in thousands) | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |\n| Cash paid for operating lease liabilities | | | $ | 451,525 |  |  | | | $ | 413,034 |  |  | | | $ | 349,586 |  |\n| Right-of-use assets obtained in exchange for new operating lease obligations | | | 196,639 | |  |  | | | 252,393 | |  |  | | | 764,142 | |  |\n\n52', "Table of Contents\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|  | | | As of December 31, | | | | | | | | |\n|  | | | 2023 | | |  | | | 2022 | | |\n|  | | | (in thousands, except lease term and discount rate) | | | | | | | | |\n| Operating lease right-of-use assets, net | | | $ | 2,076,899 |  |  | | | $ | 2,227,122 |  |\n|  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |\n| Current operating lease liabilities | | | $ | 383,312 |  |  | | | $ | 355,985 |  |\n| Non-current operating lease liabilities | | | 2,046,801 | |  |  | | | 2,222,503 | |  |\n| Total operating lease liabilities | | | $ | 2,430,113 |  |  | | | $ | 2,578,488 |  |\n|  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |\n| Weighted-average remaining lease term | | | 7.5 years | | |  | | | 8.3 years | | |\n| Weighted-average discount rate | | | 3.3 | | % |  | | | 3.2 | | % |\n\nMaturities of operating lease liabilities as of December\xa031, 2023 were as follows (in thousands):\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| Due in 12 month period ended December 31, | | | | | |\n| 2024 | | | $ | 460,353 |  |\n| 2025 | | | 424,897 | |  |\n| 2026 | | | 401,306 | |  |\n| 2027 | | | 340,245 | |  |\n| 2028 | | | 282,465 | |  |\n| Thereafter | | | 827,117 | |  |\n|  | | | 2,736,383 | |  |\n| Less imputed interest | | | (306,270) | |  |\n| Total operating lease liabilities | | | $ | 2,430,113 |  |\n\nThe Company has additional operating leases for real estate of $343 million which have not commenced as of December\xa031, 2023, and as such, have not been recognized on the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets.

A portion of the outstanding Notes is denominated in foreign currency (comprised of €5,170 million) and is remeasured into U.S. dollars at each balance sheet date (with remeasurement loss totaling $176 million for the year ended December\xa031, 2023).\n\nThe following table provides a summary of the Company\'s outstanding debt and the fair values based on quoted market prices in less active markets as of December\xa031, 2023 and December\xa031, 2022:\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|  | | | Principal Amount at Par | | | | | | | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | | Level 2 Fair Value as of | | | | | | | | |\n|  | | | December 31, 2023 | | |  | | | December 31, 2022 | | |  | | | Issuance Date | | |  | | | Maturity | | |  | | | December 31, 2023 | | |  | | | December 31, 2022 | | |\n|  | | | (in millions) | | | | | | | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | | (in millions) | | | | | | | | |\n|  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |\n| 5.750% Senior Notes | | | $ | 400 |  |  | | | $ | 400 |  |  | | | February 2014 | | |  | | | March 2024 | | |  | | | $ | 400 |  |  | | | $ | 404 |  |\n| 5.875% Senior Notes | | | 800 | |  |  | | | 800 | |  |  | | | February 2015 | | |  | | | February 2025 | | |  | | | 807 | |  |  | | | 811 | |  |\n| 3.000% Senior Notes (1) | | | 519 | |  |  | | | 503 | |  |  | | | April 2020 | | |  | | | June 2025 | | |  | | | 516 | |  |  | | | 495 | |  |\n| 3.625% Senior Notes | | | 500 | |  |  | | | 500 | |  |  | | | April 2020 | | |  | | | June 2025 | | |  | | | 491 | |  |  | | | 479 | |  |\n| 4.375% Senior Notes | | | 1,000 | |  |  | | | 1,000 | |  |  | | | October 2016 | | |  | | | November 2026 | | |  | | | 996 | |  |  | | | 980 | |  |\n| 3.625% Senior Notes (1) | | | 1,434 | |  |  | | | 1,391 | |  |  | | | May 2017 | | |  | | | May 2027 | | |  | | | 1,454 | |  |  | | | 1,338 | |  |\n| 4.875% Senior Notes | | | 1,600 | |  |  | | | 1,600 | |  |  | | | October 2017 | | |  | | | April 2028 | | |  | | | 1,621 | |  |  | | | 1,557 | |  |\n| 5.875% Senior Notes | | | 1,900 | |  |  | | | 1,900 | |  |  | | | April 2018 | | |  | | | November 2028 | | |  | | | 2,009 | |  |  | | | 1,930 | |  |\n| 4.625% Senior Notes (1) | | | 1,215 | |  |  | | | 1,177 | |  |  | | | October 2018 | | |  | | | May 2029 | | |  | | | 1,300 | |  |  | | | 1,151 | |  |\n| 6.375% Senior Notes | | | 800 | |  |  | | | 800 | |  |  | | | October 2018 | | |  | | | May 2029 | | |  | | | 872 | |  |  | | | 830 | |  |\n| 3.875% Senior Notes (1) | | | 1,325 | |  |  | | | 1,284 | |  |  | | | April 2019 | | |  | | | November 2029 | | |  | | | 1,372 | |  |  | | | 1,201 | |  |\n| 5.375% Senior Notes | | | 900 | |  |  | | | 900 | |  |  | | | April 2019 | | |  | | | November 2029 | | |  | | | 931 | |  |  | | | 885 | |  |\n| 3.625% Senior Notes (1) | | | 1,215 | |  |  | | | 1,177 | |  |  | | | October 2019 | | |  | | | June 2030 | | |  | | | 1,237 | |  |  | | | 1,078 | |  |\n| 4.875% Senior Notes | | | 1,000 | |  |  | | | 1,000 | |  |  | | | October 2019 | | |  | | | June 2030 | | |  | | | 1,012 | |  |  | | | 944 | |  |\n|  | | | $ | 14,608 |  |  | | | $ | 14,432 |  |  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | | $ | 15,018 |  |  | | | $ | 14,083 |  |\n|  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |\n|  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |\n|  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |\n\n(1) The following Senior Notes have a principal amount denominated in euro: 3.000% Senior Notes for €470\xa0million, 3.625% Senior Notes for €1,300\xa0million, 4.625% Senior Notes for €1,100\xa0million, 3.875% Senior Notes for €1,200\xa0million, and 3.625% Senior Notes for €1,100\xa0million.\n\nEach of the Notes are repayable in whole or in part upon the occurrence of a change of control, at the option of the holders, at a purchase price in cash equal to 101% of the principal plus accrued interest. The Company may redeem the Notes prior to maturity in whole or in part at an amount equal to the principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest and an applicable premium. The Notes include, among other terms and conditions, limitations on the Company\'s ability to create, incur or allow certain liens; enter into sale and lease-back transactions; create, assume, incur or guarantee additional indebtedness of certain of the Company\'s subsidiaries; and consolidate or merge with, or convey, transfer or lease all or substantially all of the Company\'s and its subsidiaries assets, to another person. As of December\xa031, 2023 and December\xa031, 2022, the Company was in compliance with all related covenants.\n\nRevolving Credit\xa0Facility\n\nOn March 6, 2023, the Company amended its $1\xa0billion unsecured revolving credit facility ("Revolving Credit Agreement") to replace the London interbank offered rate to a variable secured overnight financing rate (the “Term SOFR Rate”) as the rate to which interest payments are indexed, among other things. The Revolving Credit Agreement matures on June 17, 2026. Revolving loans may be borrowed, repaid and reborrowed until June 17, 2026, at which time all amounts borrowed must be repaid. The Company may use the proceeds of future borrowings under the Revolving Credit Agreement for\n\n54', 'Table of Contents\n\nworking capital and general corporate purposes. As of\xa0December\xa031, 2023, no amounts have been borrowed under the Revolving Credit Agreement.\n\nThe borrowings under the Revolving Credit Agreement bear interest, at the Company’s option, of either (i) a floating rate equal to a base rate (the “Alternate Base Rate”) or (ii) a rate equal to the Term SOFR Rate (or the applicable benchmark replacement), plus a margin of\xa00.75%. The Alternate Base Rate is defined as the greatest of (A) the rate of interest published by the Wall Street Journal, from time to time, as the prime rate, (B) the federal funds rate, plus\xa00.50%\xa0and (C) the Term SOFR Rate for a one-month tenor, plus\xa01.00%. The Term SOFR Rate is the forward-looking secured overnight financing rate administered by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York or a successor administrator, for the relevant interest period, but in no event shall the Term SOFR Rate be less than\xa00.00%\xa0per annum.\n\nThe Company is also obligated to pay a commitment fee on the undrawn amounts of the Revolving Credit Agreement at an annual rate of\xa00.10%. The Revolving Credit Agreement requires the Company to comply with certain covenants, including covenants that limit or restrict the ability of the Company’s subsidiaries to incur debt and limit or restrict the ability of the Company and its subsidiaries to grant liens and enter into sale and leaseback transactions; and, in the case of the Company or a guarantor, merge, consolidate, liquidate, dissolve or sell, transfer, lease or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole. As of\xa0December\xa031, 2023 and December\xa031, 2022, the Company was in compliance with all related covenants.\n\n7.Derivative Financial Instruments\n\nIn the fiscal year ended December\xa031, 2023, the Company entered into derivative financial instruments to manage foreign exchange risk related to its ongoing business operations with the primary objective of reducing operating income and cash flow volatility associated with fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. The Company did not use any derivative instruments prior to the fiscal year ended December\xa031, 2023.\n\nNotional Amount of Derivative Contracts\n\nThe net notional amounts of the Company’s outstanding derivative instruments were as follows:\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|  | | | As\xa0of December 31, | | | | | | | | |\n|  | | | 2023 | | |  | | | 2022 | | |\n|  | | | (in thousands) | | | | | | | | |\n| Derivatives designated as hedging instruments: | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |\n| Foreign exchange contracts | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |\n| Cash flow hedges | | | $ | 8,783,273 |  |  | | | $ | — |  |\n| Total | | | $ | 8,783,273 |  |  | | | $ | — |  |\n\nFair Value of Derivative Contracts\n\nThe fair value of the Company’s outstanding derivative instruments were as follows:\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|  | | | As of December 31, 2023 | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |\n|  | | | Derivative Assets | | | | | | | | |  | | | Derivative Liabilities | | | | | | | | |\n|  | | | Other current assets | | |  | | | Other non-current assets | | |  | | | Accrued expenses and other liabilities | | |  | | | Other non-current liabilities | | |\n|  | | | (in thousands) | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |\n| Derivatives designated as hedging instruments: | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |\n| Foreign exchange contracts | | | $ | 26,416 |  |  | | | $ | 4,518 |  |  | | | $ | 140,089 |  |  | | | $ | 46,575 |  |\n| Total | | | $ | 26,416 |  |  | | | $ | 4,518 |  |  | | | $ | 140,089 |  |  | | | $ | 46,575 |  |\n|  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |\n|  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |\n\nThe Company classifies derivative instruments in the Level 2 category within the fair value hierarchy. These instruments are valued using industry standard valuation models that use observable inputs such as interest rate yield curves, and forward and spot prices for currencies.\n\nAs of December\xa031, 2023, the pre-tax net accumulated loss on our foreign currency cash flow hedges included in AOCI on the Consolidated Balance Sheets expected to be recognized in earnings within the next 12 months is $128\xa0million.\n\n55', 'Table of Contents\n\nMaster Netting Agreements\n\nIn order to mitigate counterparty credit risk, the Company enters into master netting agreements with its counterparties for its foreign currency exchange contracts, which permit the parties to settle amounts on a net basis under certain conditions. The Company has elected to present its derivative assets and liabilities on a gross basis on its Consolidated Balance Sheets.\n\nThe Company also enters into collateral security arrangements with its counterparties that require the parties to post cash collateral when certain contractual thresholds are met. No cash collateral was received or posted by the Company as of December\xa031, 2023.\n\nThe potential offsetting effect to the Company’s derivative assets and liabilities under its master netting agreements and collateral security agreements were as follows:\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|  | | | As of December 31, 2023 | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |\n|  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | | Gross Amount Not Offset in the Consolidated Balance Sheets | | | | | | | | |  | | |  | | |\n|  | | | Gross Amount Recognized in the Consolidated Balance Sheets | | |  | | | Gross Amount Offset in the Consolidated Balance Sheets | | |  | | | Net Amount Presented in the Consolidated Balance Sheets | | |  | | | Financial Instruments | | |  | | | Collateral Received and Posted | | |  | | | Net Amount | | |\n|  | | | (in thousands) | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |\n| Derivative assets | | | $ | 30,934 |  |  | | | $ | — |  |  | | | $ | 30,934 |  |  | | | $ | (27,246) |  |  | | | $ | — |  |  | | | $ | 3,688 |  |\n| Derivative liabilities | | | 186,664 | |  |  | | | — | |  |  | | | 186,664 | |  |  | | | (27,246) | |  |  | | | — | |  |  | | | 159,418 | |  |\n|  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |\n|  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |\n\nEffect of Derivative Instruments on Consolidated Financial Statements\n\nThe pre-tax gains (losses) on the Company’s cash flow hedges recognized in AOCI were as follows:\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |\n|  | | | Year Ended December 31, | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |  | | |  | | |\n|  | | | 2023 | | |  | | | 2022 | | |  | | | 2021 | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |\n|  | | | (in thousands) | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |\n| Cash flow hedges: | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |\n| Foreign exchange contracts (1) | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |\n| Amount included in the assessment of effectiveness | | | $ | (155,730) |  |  | | | $ | — |  |  | | | $ | — |  |  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |\n| Total | | | $ | (155,730) |  |  | | | $ | — |  |  | | | $ | — |  |  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |\n\n(1) No amounts were excluded from the assessment of effectiveness.\n\nNo gains or losses on derivative instruments were reclassified from AOCI into the Consolidated Statements of Operations in the year ended December\xa031, 2023.\n\n8. Commitments and Contingencies\n\nContent\n\nAt December\xa031, 2023, the Company had $21.7 billion of obligations comprised of $4.5 billion included in "Current content liabilities" and $2.6 billion of "Non-current content liabilities" on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and $14.6 billion of obligations that are not reflected on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as they did not yet meet the criteria for recognition.\n\nAt December\xa031, 2022, the Company had $21.8 billion of obligations comprised of $4.5 billion included in "Current content liabilities" and $3.1 billion of "Non-current content liabilities" on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and $14.2 billion of obligations that are not reflected on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as they did not yet meet the criteria for recognition.\n\nThe expected timing of payments for these content obligations is as follows:\n\n56', "Table of Contents\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|  | | | As of December 31, | | | | | | | | |\n|  | | | 2023 | | |  | | | 2022 | | |\n|  | | | (in\xa0thousands) | | | | | | | | |\n| Less than one year | | | $ | 10,328,923 |  |  | | | $ | 10,038,483 |  |\n| Due after one year and through 3 years | | | 8,784,302 | |  |  | | | 9,425,551 | |  |\n| Due after 3 years and through 5 years | | | 2,016,358 | |  |  | | | 2,124,307 | |  |\n| Due after 5 years | | | 583,766 | |  |  | | | 243,606 | |  |\n| Total content obligations | | | $ | 21,713,349 |  |  | | | $ | 21,831,947 |  |\n\nContent obligations include amounts related to the acquisition, licensing and production of content. Obligations that are in non-U.S. dollar currencies are translated to the U.S. dollar at period end rates. An obligation for the production of content includes non-cancelable commitments under creative talent and employment agreements as well as other production related commitments. An obligation for the acquisition and licensing of content is incurred at the time the Company enters into an agreement to obtain future titles. Once a title becomes available, a content liability is recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Certain agreements include the obligation to license rights for unknown future titles, the ultimate quantity and/or fees for which are not yet determinable as of the reporting date. Traditional film output deals, or certain TV series license agreements where the number of seasons to be aired is unknown, are examples of such license agreements. The Company does not include any estimated obligation for these future titles beyond the known minimum amount. However, the unknown obligations are expected to be significant.\n\nLegal Proceedings\n\nFrom time to time, in the normal course of its operations, the Company is subject to litigation matters and claims, including claims relating to employee relations, business practices and patent infringement. Litigation can be expensive and disruptive to normal business operations. Moreover, the results of complex legal proceedings are difficult to predict and the Company's view of these matters may change in the future as the litigation and events related thereto unfold. The Company expenses legal fees as incurred. The Company records a provision for contingent losses when it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. An unfavorable outcome to any legal matter, if material, could have an adverse effect on the Company's operations or its financial position, liquidity or results of operations.\n\nThe Company is involved in litigation matters not listed herein but does not consider the matters to be material either individually or in the aggregate at this time. The Company's view of the matters not listed may change in the future as the litigation and events related thereto unfold.\n\nNon-Income Taxes\n\nThe Company is routinely under audit by various tax authorities with regard to non-income tax matters. The subject matter of non-income tax audits primarily arises from disputes on the tax treatment and tax rate applied to our revenue in certain jurisdictions. We accrue non-income taxes that may result from examinations by, or any negotiated agreements with, these tax authorities when a loss is probable and reasonably estimable.\n\nSimilar to other U.S. companies doing business in Brazil, the Company is involved in a number of matters with Brazilian tax authorities regarding non-income tax assessments. Although the Company believes it has meritorious defenses to these matters, there is inherent complexity and uncertainty with respect to these matters, and the final outcome may be materially different from our expectations. The current potential exposure with respect to the various issues with Brazilian tax authorities regarding non-income tax assessments is estimated to be approximately $300\xa0million, which is expected to increase over time.\n\nGuarantees—Indemnification Obligations\n\nIn the ordinary course of business, the Company has entered into contractual arrangements under which it has agreed to provide indemnification of varying scope and terms to business partners and other parties with respect to certain matters, including, but not limited to, losses arising out of the Company’s breach of such agreements and out of intellectual property infringement claims made by third parties. In these circumstances, payment may be conditional on the other party making a claim pursuant to the procedures specified in the particular contract.\n\nThe Company’s obligations under these agreements may be limited in terms of time or amount, and in some instances, the Company may have recourse against third parties for certain payments. In addition, the Company has entered into indemnification agreements with its directors and certain of its officers that will require it, among other things, to indemnify\n\n57", 'Table of Contents\n\nthem against certain liabilities that may arise by reason of their status or service as directors or officers.

The Company believes that implied volatility of publicly traded options in its common stock is more reflective of market conditions, and given consistently high trade volumes of the options, can reasonably be expected to be a better indicator of expected volatility than historical volatility of its common stock.\n\nIn valuing shares issued under the Company’s employee stock option plans, the Company bases the risk-free interest rate on U.S. Treasury zero-coupon issues with terms similar to the contractual term of the options. The Company does not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future and therefore uses an expected dividend yield of\xa0zero\xa0in the option valuation model. The Company does not use a post-vesting termination rate as options are generally fully vested upon grant date.\n\nThe total fair value of stock options that vested during the year ended December\xa031, 2023 was $311\xa0million. The Company did not grant any stock options subject to vesting conditions in the years ended December\xa031, 2022 and 2021. As of December\xa031, 2023, $26\xa0million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to nonvested stock options is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 0.45 years.\n\nStock Repurchases\n\nIn March 2021, the Company’s Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $5\xa0billion of its common stock, with no expiration date, and in September 2023, the Board of Directors increased the share repurchase authorization by an additional $10\xa0billion, also with no expiration date. Stock repurchases may be effected through open market repurchases in compliance with Rule 10b-18 under the Exchange Act, including through the use of trading plans intended to qualify under Rule 10b5-1 under the Exchange Act, privately-negotiated transactions, accelerated stock repurchase plans, block purchases, or other similar purchase techniques and in such amounts as management deems appropriate. The Company is not obligated to repurchase any specific number of shares, and the timing and actual number of shares repurchased will depend on a variety of factors, including the Company’s stock price, general economic, business and market conditions, and alternative investment opportunities. The Company may discontinue any repurchases of its common stock at any time without prior notice. During the year ended December\xa031, 2023, the Company repurchased 14,513,790 shares for an aggregate amount of $6,045\xa0million. As of December\xa031, 2023, $8.4\xa0billion remains available for repurchases. Shares repurchased by the Company are accounted for when the transaction is settled.

The aggregate changes in the Company’s total gross amount of unrecognized tax benefits are summarized as follows:\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|  | | | As of\xa0December\xa031, | | | | | | | | |\n|  | | | 2023 | | | 2022 | | | 2021 | | |\n|  | | | (in thousands) | | | | | | | | |\n| Balance at the beginning of the year | | | $ | 226,977 |  | $ | 202,557 |  | $ | 140,124 |  |\n| Increases related to tax positions taken during the current period | | | 65,630 | |  | 26,865 | |  | 35,317 | |  |\n| Increases related to tax positions taken during prior periods | | | 76,794 | |  | — | |  | 27,116 | |  |\n| Decreases related to tax positions taken during prior periods | | | (10,117) | |  | (2,445) | |  | — | |  |\n| Decreases related to settlements with taxing authorities | | | (32,179) | |  | — | |  | — | |  |\n| Decreases related to expiration of statute of limitations | | | — | |  | — | |  | — | |  |\n| Balance at the end of the year | | | $ | 327,105 |  | $ | 226,977 |  | $ | 202,557 |  |\n\nThe Company includes interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits within the provision for income taxes and in “Other non-current liabilities” in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. During the years ended December\xa031, 2023, 2022 and 2021, the Company recorded $25\xa0million, $2\xa0million, and less than $1\xa0million, respectively, of interest and penalties in the provision for income taxes. The amount of interest and penalties accrued at December 31, 2023 and 2022 was $28\xa0million and $3\xa0million, respectively.\n\nThe Company files U.S. Federal, state and foreign tax returns. The Company is currently under examination by the IRS for years 2016 through 2018 and is subject to examination for 2019 through 2022. The foreign and state tax returns for years 2016 through 2022 are subject to examination by various state and foreign jurisdictions. While the Company is in various stages of inquiry and examination with certain taxing authorities and we believe that our tax positions will more likely than not be sustained, it is nonetheless possible that future obligations related to these matters could arise. We believe that adequate amounts have been reserved for any adjustments that may ultimately result from an examination.\n\nGiven the potential outcome of current examinations, it is reasonably possible that the balance of unrecognized tax benefits could significantly change within the next twelve months. However, an estimate of the range of reasonably possible adjustments cannot be made at this time.\n\n11.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Employee Benefit Plan\n\nThe Company maintains a 401(k) savings plan covering substantially all of its employees. Eligible employees may contribute up to 80% of their annual salary through payroll deductions, but not more than the statutory limits set by the Internal Revenue Service. The Company matches employee contributions at the discretion of the Board. During the years ended December\xa031, 2023, 2022 and 2021, the Company’s matching contributions totaled $114 million, $102 million and $85 million, respectively.\n\n63', 'Table of Contents\n\nMultiemployer Benefit Plans\n\nThe Company contributes to various multiemployer defined pension plans under the terms of collective bargaining agreements that cover our union-represented employees. The risks of participating in multiemployer pension plans are different from single-employer plans such that (i) contributions made by the Company to the multiemployer pension plans may be used to provide benefits to employees of other participating employers; (ii) if the Company chooses to stop participating in the multiemployer pension plans, it may be required to pay those plans an amount based on the underfunded status of the plan; and (iii) if a company stops contributing to the multiemployer pension plan, the unfunded obligations of the plan may become the obligation of the remaining participating employers. The Company also contributes to various other multiemployer benefit plans that provide health and welfare benefits to both active and retired participants. The Company does not participate in any multiemployer benefit plans that are individually significant to the Company.\n\nThe following table summarizes the Company\'s contributions to multiemployer pension and health plans for the years ended December\xa031, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively:\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|  | | | Year Ended December\xa031, | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |\n|  | | | 2023 | | |  | | | 2022 | | |  | | | 2021 | | |\n|  | | | (in thousands) | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |\n| Pension benefits | | | $ | 57,285 |  |  | | | $ | 127,885 |  |  | | | $ | 111,133 |  |\n| Health benefits | | | 85,157 | |  |  | | | 96,285 | |  |  | | | 83,153 | |  |\n| Total contributions | | | $ | 142,442 |  |  | | | $ | 224,170 |  |  | | | $ | 194,286 |  |\n\n12.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Segment and Geographic Information\n\nThe Company operates as one operating segment. The Company\'s chief operating decision maker ("CODM") is its co-chief executive officers, who review financial information presented on a consolidated basis for purposes of making operating decisions, assessing financial performance and allocating resources.\n\nTotal U.S. revenues were $13.8 billion, $13.0 billion and $12.1 billion for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively.

(“Netflix”, “the Company”, “registrant”, “we”, or “us”) is one of the world’s leading entertainment services with approximately 231 million paid memberships in over 190 countries enjoying TV series, films and games across a wide variety of genres and languages. Members can play, pause and resume to watch as much as they want, anytime, anywhere, and can change their plans at any time.\n\nOur core strategy is to grow our business globally within the parameters of our operating margin target. We strive to continuously improve our members\' experience by offering compelling content that delights them and attracts new members. We seek to drive conversation around our content to further enhance member joy, and we are continuously enhancing our user interface to help our members more easily choose content that they will find enjoyable.\n\nBUSINESS SEGMENTS\n\nWe operate as one operating segment. Our revenues are primarily derived from monthly membership fees for services related to streaming content to our members. See Note 12, Segment and Geographic Information, in the accompanying notes to our consolidated financial statements for further detail.\n\nCOMPETITION\n\nThe market for entertainment video is intensely competitive and subject to rapid change. We compete with a broad set of activities for consumers’ leisure time, including other entertainment video providers, such as linear TV, streaming entertainment providers (including those that provide pirated content), video gaming providers and more broadly against other sources of entertainment, like social media, that our members could choose in their moments of free time. We also compete against entertainment video providers and content producers in obtaining content for our service, both for licensed content and for original content projects.\n\nWhile consumers may maintain simultaneous relationships with multiple entertainment sources, we strive for consumers to choose us in their moments of free time. We have often referred to this choice as our objective of "winning moments of truth." In attempting to win these moments of truth with our members, we seek to continually improve our service, including both our technology and our content offerings.\n\nSEASONALITY\n\n1', 'Table of Contents\n\nOur membership growth exhibits a seasonal pattern that reflects variations when consumers buy internet-connected screens and when they tend to increase their viewing. Historically, the fourth quarter represents our greatest streaming membership growth. In addition, our membership growth can be impacted by our content release schedule and changes to pricing.\n\nINTELLECTUAL PROPERTY\n\nWe regard our trademarks, service marks, copyrights, patents, domain names, trade dress, trade secrets, proprietary technologies and similar intellectual property as important to our success. We use a combination of patent, trademark, copyright and trade secret laws and confidentiality agreements to protect our proprietary intellectual property. Our intellectual property rights extend to our technology, business processes and the content we produce and distribute through our service. We use the intellectual property of third parties in creating some of our content, merchandising our products and marketing our service. Our ability to provide our members with content they can watch depends on studios, content providers and other rights holders licensing rights, including distribution rights, to such content and certain related elements thereof, such as the public performance of music contained within the content we distribute. The license periods and the terms and conditions of such licenses vary. Our ability to protect and enforce our intellectual property rights is subject to certain risks and from time to time we encounter disputes over rights and obligations concerning intellectual property. We cannot provide assurance that we will prevail in any intellectual property disputes.\n\nREGULATION\n\nThe media landscape and the internet delivery of content have seen growing regulatory action. Historically, media has been highly regulated in many countries. We are seeing some of these legacy regulatory frameworks be updated and expanded to address services like ours. In particular, we are seeing some countries update their cultural support legislation to include services like Netflix. This includes content quotas, levies and investment obligations. Some even restrict the extent of ownership rights we can have both in our service and in our content. In certain countries, regulators are also looking at restrictions that could require formal reviews of and/or adjustments to content that appears on our service in their country. In general these regulations impact all services and may make operating in certain jurisdictions more expensive or restrictive as to the content offerings we may provide.\n\nHUMAN CAPITAL\n\nWe view our employees and our culture as key to our success. As of December\xa031, 2022, we had approximately 12,800 full-time employees located globally in 65 countries. Of these, approximately 9,000 (70%) were located in the United States and Canada, 2,000 (16%) in Europe, Middle East, and Africa, 400 (3%) in Latin America and 1,400 (11%) in Asia-Pacific. We also have a number of employees engaged in content production, some of whom are part-time or temporary, and whose numbers fluctuate throughout the year.\n\nWe believe a critical component of our success is our company culture. This culture, which is detailed in a "Culture Memo" located on our website, is often described as a high-performance culture of freedom and responsibility. We aim to attract and retain great people - representing a diverse array of perspectives and skills - to work together as a dream team. We empower all of our employees so that they can have significant impact and input into decision-making; each employee has the freedom and power to make the decisions and take actions in the best interest of the company in carrying out their role. In return, our employees are responsible and accountable for those decisions and actions. With this approach, we believe we are a more flexible, fun, stimulating, creative, collaborative and successful organization.\n\nAs we have expanded our offices globally, our company culture remains an important aspect of our operations. We have also become mindful of cultural differences across and within regions. Fostering a work environment that is culturally diverse, inclusive and equitable is a major focus for us. We work to build diversity, inclusion and equity into all aspects of our operations globally, with the goal of having diversity and inclusion function as a critical lens through which each Netflix employee carries out their role. We want more people and cultures to see themselves reflected on screen - so it’s important that our employee base is diverse and represents the communities we serve. We look to help increase representation by training our recruiters on how to hire more inclusively, and to help the company and senior leaders diversify their networks. We also support numerous employee resource groups (ERGs), representing employees and allies from a broad array of historically underrepresented and/or marginalized communities. We publish an Inclusion report annually which further highlights our approach to diversity and inclusion, and publish our EEO-1 reports on our website.\n\nWe believe in fostering great leaders. We offer programs, such as seminars and lectures, that help our leaders (officers, VPs and director-level employees) examine values that guide them personally, and as leaders, especially when those values come into tension with the world around us. The goal of these programs is to create great human beings, who become great\n\n2', 'Table of Contents\n\nleaders, who shape a great company. We also offer programs and workshops to provide skills and coaching to employees on a variety of topics, such as leading and inspiring teams. We believe this focus helps our employees grow as leaders and well-rounded individuals, and better positions Netflix to operate our global business of providing compelling content to entertain the world.\n\nWe aim to generally pay our employees at the top of their personal market, and they generally are able to choose the form of their compensation between cash and stock options. This permits employee compensation to be highly personalized and reflective of each employee\'s individual needs and preferences. We conduct pay equity analyses at least annually, and have adopted practices to help ensure that employees from underrepresented groups are not being underpaid based on gender (globally) and race (U.S.) relative to others doing the same or similar work under comparable circumstances. We aim to rectify any pay gaps that we find through this analysis.\n\nWe care about the health and well-being of our employees and their families and provide a variety of benefit programs based on region, including health benefits. In the U.S., employees generally receive an annual cash health benefit allowance that they may allocate to medical, dental and vision premiums in a way that makes sense for them. Employees have access to a host of other benefits, including mental health, childcare, family planning and a company match for charitable donations.\n\nWe believe that our approach to human capital resources has been instrumental in our growth, and has made Netflix a desirable destination for employees.\n\nOTHER INFORMATION\n\nWe maintain a website at www.netflix.com. The contents of our website are not incorporated in, or otherwise to be regarded as part of, this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We make available, free of charge on our website, access to our Annual Report on Form 10-K, our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, our Current Reports on Form 8-K and amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), as soon as reasonably practicable after we file or furnish them electronically with the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC").\n\nInvestors and others should note that we announce material financial information to our investors using our investor relations website (ir.netflix.net), SEC filings, press releases, public conference calls and webcasts. We use these channels as well as social media and blogs to communicate with our members and the public about our company, our services and other issues. It is possible that the information we post on social media and blogs could be deemed to be material information. Therefore, we encourage investors, the media, and others interested in our company to review the information we post on the social media channels and blogs listed on our investor relations website.\n\n3', 'Table of Contents\n\nItem 1A.Risk Factors\n\nIf any of the following risks actually occur, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be harmed. In that case, the trading price of our common stock could decline, and you could lose all or part of your investment.\n\nRisks Related to Our Business\n\nIf our efforts to attract and retain members are not successful, our business will be adversely affected.\n\nWe must continually add new members both to replace canceled memberships and to grow our business beyond our current membership base. Our penetration and growth rates have fluctuated and vary across the jurisdictions where we provide our service. In countries where we have been operating for many years or where we are highly penetrated, our membership growth is slower than in newer or less penetrated countries. Our ability to continue to attract and retain members will depend in part on our ability to consistently provide our members in countries around the globe with compelling content choices that keep our members engaged with our service, effectively drive conversation around our content and service, as well as provide a quality experience for choosing and enjoying TV series, films and games. Furthermore, the relative service levels, content offerings, pricing and related features of competitors to our service may adversely impact our ability to attract and retain members. Competitors include other entertainment video providers, such as linear television, and streaming entertainment providers (including those that provide pirated content), video gaming providers, as well as user-generated content, and more broadly other sources of entertainment that our members could choose in their moments of free time.\n\nMembers cancel our service for many reasons, including a perception that they do not use the service sufficiently, that they need to cut household expenses, dissatisfaction with content, a preference for competitive services and customer service issues that they believe are not satisfactorily resolved. Membership growth is also impacted by seasonality, with the fourth quarter historically representing our greatest growth, as well as the timing of our content release schedules. Adverse macroeconomic conditions, including inflation, may also adversely impact our ability to attract and retain members. If we do not grow as expected, given, in particular, that our content costs are largely fixed in nature, we may not be able to adjust our expenditures or increase our (per membership) revenues, including by adjusting membership pricing, commensurate with the lowered growth rate such that our margins, liquidity and results of operations may be adversely impacted. If we are unable to successfully compete with current and new competitors in providing compelling content, retaining our existing members and attracting new members, our business will be adversely affected.\n\nIf we do not continuously provide value to our members, including making improvements to our service in a manner that is favorably received by them, our revenue, results of operations and business will be adversely affected.\n\nIf consumers do not perceive our service offering to be of value, including if we introduce new or adjust existing features, adjust pricing or service offerings, or change the mix of content in a manner that is not favorably received by them, we may not be able to attract and retain members, and accordingly, our revenue, including revenue per paying membership, and results of operations may be adversely affected. We have recently expanded our entertainment video offering to include games. If our efforts to develop and offer games are not valued by our current and future members, our ability to attract and retain members may be negatively impacted. We may, from time to time, adjust our membership pricing, our membership plans, or our pricing model itself. For example, we recently introduced a new, lower-priced ad-supported subscription plan. Similarly, we have increased and anticipate continuing to increase our efforts to limit multi-household usage and to otherwise enforce our terms of use relative to shared viewing outside a household. These and other adjustments we make may not be well-received by consumers, and could negatively impact our ability to attract and retain members, revenues per paying membership, revenue and our results of operations. In addition, many of our members rejoin our service or originate from word-of-mouth advertising from existing members. If our efforts to satisfy our existing members or adjustments to our service are not successful, we may not be able to attract or retain members, and as a result, our ability to maintain and/or grow our business will be adversely affected.\n\nChanges in competitive offerings for entertainment video could adversely impact our business.\n\nThe market for entertainment is intensely competitive and subject to rapid change. Through new and existing distribution channels, consumers have increasing options to access entertainment video. The various economic models underlying these channels include subscription, transactional, ad-supported and piracy-based models. All of these have the potential to capture meaningful segments of the entertainment video market. Traditional providers of entertainment video, including broadcasters and cable network operators, as well as internet based e-commerce or entertainment video providers are increasing their streaming video offerings. Several of these competitors have long operating histories, large customer bases, strong brand recognition, exclusive rights to certain content, large content libraries, and significant financial, marketing and other resources.\n\n4', 'Table of Contents\n\nThey may offer more compelling content or secure better terms from suppliers, adopt more aggressive pricing and devote more resources to product development, technology, infrastructure, content acquisitions and marketing. New entrants may enter the market or existing providers may adjust their services with unique offerings or approaches to providing entertainment video. Companies also may enter into business combinations or alliances that strengthen their competitive positions. Piracy also threatens to damage our business, as its fundamental proposition to consumers is so compelling and difficult to compete against: virtually all content for free, and in light of the compelling consumer proposition, piracy services are subject to rapid global growth. If we are unable to successfully or profitably compete with current and new competitors, our business will be adversely affected, and we may not be able to increase or maintain market share, revenues or profitability.\n\nWe face risks, such as unforeseen costs and potential liability in connection with content we acquire, produce, license and/or distribute through our service.\n\nAs a producer and distributor of content, we face potential liability for negligence, copyright and trademark infringement, or other claims based on the nature and content of materials that we acquire, produce, license and/or distribute. We also may face potential liability for content used in promoting our service, including marketing materials. We devote significant resources toward the development, production, marketing and distribution of original programming, including TV series, documentaries, feature films and mobile games. We believe that original and exclusive programming can help differentiate our service from other offerings, enhance our brand and otherwise attract and retain members. To the extent our programming does not meet our expectations, in particular, in terms of costs, viewing and popularity, our business, including our brand and results of operations may be adversely impacted. As a content producer, we are responsible for production costs and other expenses, such as ongoing guild payments, and take on risks associated with production, such as completion and key talent risk, which have been heightened during the COVID-19 pandemic. Further, negotiations or renewals related to entertainment industry collective bargaining agreements could negatively impact timing and costs associated with our productions. We contract with third parties related to the development, production, marketing and distribution of our original programming. We may face potential liability or may suffer significant losses in connection with these arrangements, including but not limited to if such third parties violate applicable law, become insolvent or engage in fraudulent behavior. To the extent we create and sell physical or digital merchandise relating to our programming, and/or license such rights to third parties, we could become subject to product liability, intellectual property or other claims related to such merchandise. We may decide to remove content from our service, not to place licensed or produced content on our service or discontinue or alter production of original content if we believe such content might not be well received by our members, or could be damaging to our brand or business.\n\nTo the extent we do not accurately anticipate costs or mitigate risks, including for content that we obtain but ultimately does not appear on or is removed from our service, or if we become liable for content we acquire, produce, license and/or distribute, our business may suffer. Litigation to defend these claims could be costly and the expenses and damages arising from any liability or unforeseen production risks could harm our results of operations. We may not be indemnified against claims or costs of these types and we may not have insurance coverage for these types of claims.\n\nIf we are not able to manage change and growth, our business could be adversely affected.\n\nWe are expanding our operations internationally, scaling our streaming service to effectively and reliably handle anticipated growth in both members and features related to our services, such as introducing games and advertising on our service. We are also scaling our own studio operations to produce original content, including through acquisitions such as Scanline and Animal Logic. As our international offering evolves, we are managing and adjusting our business to address varied content offerings, consumer customs and practices, in particular those dealing with e-commerce and streaming video, as well as differing legal and regulatory environments. As we scale our streaming service and introduce new features such as our new ad-supported subscription plan, we are developing technology and utilizing third-party “cloud” computing, technology and other services. As we scale our content production, including games, and introduce new features, we are building out expertise in a number of disciplines, including creative, marketing, legal, finance, licensing, merchandising and other resources, which requires significant resources and management attention. Further, we may expand our content and service offerings in a manner that is not well received by consumers. As we grow our operations, we may face integration and operational challenges as well as potential unknown liabilities and reputational concerns in connection with partners we work with or companies we may acquire or control. If we are not able to manage the growing complexity of our business, including improving, refining or revising our corporate culture, as well as our systems and operational practices related to our streaming operations and original content, our business may be adversely affected.\n\nIf we fail to maintain a positive reputation concerning our service and the content we offer, we may not be able to attract or retain members, we may face regulatory scrutiny and our operating results may be adversely affected.\n\n5', "Table of Contents\n\nWe believe that a positive reputation concerning our service is important in attracting and retaining members. To the extent our content, in particular, our original programming, is perceived as low quality, offensive or otherwise not compelling to consumers, our ability to establish and maintain a positive reputation may be adversely impacted. To the extent our content is deemed controversial or offensive by government regulators, we may face direct or indirect retaliatory action or behavior, including being required to remove such content from our service, our entire service could be banned and/or become subject to heightened regulatory scrutiny across our business and operations. We could also face boycotts which could adversely affect our business. Furthermore, to the extent our response to government action or our marketing, customer service and public relations efforts are not effective or result in negative reaction, our ability to establish and maintain a positive reputation may likewise be adversely impacted. There is an increasing focus from regulators, investors, members and other stakeholders on environmental, social, and governance (“ESG”) matters, both in the United States and internationally. To the extent the content we distribute and the manner in which we produce content creates ESG related concerns, our reputation may be harmed.\n\nOur business could be adversely impacted by costs and challenges associated with strategic acquisitions and investments.\n\nFrom time to time, we acquire or invest in businesses, content, and technologies that support our business. The risks associated with such acquisitions or investments (some of which may be unforeseen) include the difficulty of integrating solutions, operations, and personnel; inheriting liabilities and exposure to litigation; failure to realize anticipated benefits and expected synergies; and diversion of management’s time and attention, among other acquisition-related risks.\n\nWe may not be successful in overcoming such risks, and such acquisitions and investments may negatively impact our business. In addition, if we do not complete an announced acquisition transaction or integrate an acquired business successfully and in a timely manner, we may not realize the benefits of the acquisition to the extent anticipated. Acquisitions and investments may contribute to fluctuations in our quarterly financial results. These fluctuations could arise from transaction-related costs and charges associated with eliminating redundant expenses or write-offs of impaired assets recorded in connection with acquisitions and investments, and could negatively impact our financial results.\n\nWe rely upon a number of partners to make our service available on their devices.\n\nWe currently offer members the ability to receive streaming content through a host of internet-connected devices, including TVs, digital video players, TV set-top boxes and mobile devices. We have agreements with various cable, satellite and telecommunications operators to make our service available through the TV set-top boxes of these service providers, some of which compete directly with us or have investments in competing streaming content providers. In many instances, our agreements also include provisions by which the partner bills consumers directly for the Netflix service or otherwise offers services or products in connection with offering our service. If partners or other providers do a better job of connecting consumers with content they want to watch, for example through multi-service discovery interfaces, our service may be adversely impacted. We intend to continue to broaden our relationships with existing partners and to increase our capability to stream TV series and films to other platforms and partners over time. If we are not successful in maintaining existing and creating new relationships, or if we encounter technological, content licensing, regulatory, business or other impediments to delivering our streaming content to our members via these devices, our ability to retain members and grow our business could be adversely impacted.\n\nOur agreements with our partners are typically between one and three years in duration and our business could be adversely affected if, upon expiration, a number of our partners do not continue to provide access to our service or are unwilling to do so on terms acceptable to us, which terms may include the degree of accessibility and prominence of our service. Furthermore, devices are manufactured and sold by entities other than Netflix and while these entities should be responsible for the devices’ performance, the connection between these devices and our service may nonetheless result in consumer dissatisfaction toward us and such dissatisfaction could result in claims against us or otherwise adversely impact our business. In addition, technology changes to our streaming functionality may require that partners update their devices, or may lead to us to stop supporting the delivery of our service on certain legacy devices. If partners do not update or otherwise modify their devices, or if we discontinue support for certain devices, our service and our members' use and enjoyment could be negatively impacted.\n\nWe are subject to payment processing risk.\n\nOur members pay for our service using a variety of different payment methods, including credit and debit cards, gift cards, prepaid cards, direct debit, online wallets and direct carrier and partner billing. We rely on internal systems and those of third parties to process payment. Acceptance and processing of these payment methods are subject to certain rules, regulations, and industry standards, including data storage requirements, additional authentication requirements for certain payment methods, and require payment of interchange and other fees. To the extent there are increases in payment processing fees,\n\n6", "Table of Contents\n\nmaterial changes in the payment ecosystem, such as large re-issuances of payment cards, delays in receiving payments from payment processors, changes to rules, regulations or industry standards concerning payments, loss of payment partners and/or disruptions or failures in our payment processing systems, partner systems or payment products, including products we use to update payment information, our revenue, operating expenses and results of operations could be adversely impacted. In certain instances, we leverage third parties such as our cable and other partners to bill subscribers on our behalf. If these third parties become unwilling or unable to continue processing payments on our behalf, we would have to transition subscribers or otherwise find alternative methods of collecting payments, which could adversely impact member acquisition and retention. In addition, from time to time, we encounter fraudulent use of payment methods, which could impact our results of operations and if not adequately controlled and managed could create negative consumer perceptions of our service. If we are unable to maintain our fraud and chargeback rate at acceptable levels, card networks may impose fines, our card approval rate may be impacted and we may be subject to additional card authentication requirements. The termination of our ability to process payments on any major payment method would significantly impair our ability to operate our business.\n\nIf government regulations relating to the internet or other areas of our business change, we may need to alter the manner in which we conduct our business, or incur greater operating expenses.\n\nThe adoption or modification of laws or regulations relating to the internet or other areas of our business could limit or otherwise adversely affect the manner in which we currently conduct our business. As our service and others like us gain traction in international markets, governments are increasingly looking to introduce new or extend legacy regulations to these services, in particular those related to broadcast media and tax. For example, European law enables individual member states to impose levies and other financial obligations on media operators located outside their jurisdiction. Several jurisdictions have and others may, over time, impose financial and regulatory obligations on us. In addition, the continued growth and development of the market for online commerce may lead to more stringent consumer protection laws, which may impose additional burdens on us. If we are required to comply with new regulations or legislation or new interpretations of existing regulations or legislation, this compliance could cause us to incur additional expenses or alter our business model.\n\nChanges in laws or regulations that adversely affect the growth, popularity or use of the internet, including laws impacting net neutrality or requiring payment of network access fees, could decrease the demand for our service and increase our cost of doing business. Certain laws intended to prevent network operators from discriminating against the legal traffic that traverse their networks have been implemented in many countries, including across the European Union. In others, the laws may be nascent or non-existent. Furthermore, favorable laws may change, including for example, in the United States where net neutrality regulations were repealed. Given uncertainty around these rules, including changing interpretations, amendments or repeal, coupled with potentially significant political and economic power of local network operators, we could experience discriminatory or anti-competitive practices that could impede our growth, cause us to incur additional expense or otherwise negatively affect our business.\n\nWe are engaged in legal proceedings that could cause us to incur unforeseen expenses and could occupy a significant amount of our management's time and attention.\n\nFrom time to time, we are subject to litigation or claims that could negatively affect our business operations and financial position. As we have grown, we have seen a rise in the number of litigation matters against us. These matters have included copyright and other claims related to our content, patent infringement claims, tax litigation, employment related litigation, as well as consumer and securities class actions, each of which are typically expensive to defend. Litigation disputes could cause us to incur unforeseen expenses, result in content unavailability, service disruptions, and otherwise occupy a significant amount of our management's time and attention, any of which could negatively affect our business operations and financial position. We also, from time to time, receive inquiries and subpoenas and other types of information requests from government authorities, and we may become subject to related claims and other actions related to our business activities. While the ultimate outcome of investigations, inquiries, information requests and related legal proceedings is difficult to predict, such matters can be expensive, time-consuming and distracting, and adverse resolutions or settlements of those matters may result in, among other things, modification of our business practices, reputational harm or costs and significant payments, any of which could negatively affect our business operations and financial position.\n\nOur ad-supported plan offering is new and subject to various risks and uncertainties, which may adversely affect our business.\n\nWe began offering an ad-supported subscription plan that generates revenue partially from digital advertising on our service. We have limited experience and operating history offering advertising on our service, and our advertising revenue may not grow as we expect. Our ad-supported plan offering and our ability to generate advertising revenue are subject to various risks and will depend on a number of factors, including:\n\n7", 'Table of Contents\n\n•our ability to attract and retain advertisers;\n\n•fluctuations in memberships, including those selecting the ad-supported subscription plan, and member engagement;\n\n•the quantity or quality of ads shown to our members;\n\n•our ability to compete effectively for advertising spend;\n\n•the impact of seasonal, cyclical or other shifts in advertising spend, including the impact of macroeconomic conditions;\n\n•the availability, accuracy, utility, and security of analytics and measurement solutions offered by us or third parties that demonstrate the value of our ads to marketers, or our ability to further improve such tools;\n\n•changes in the way advertising on devices, connected TVs or on personal computers is measured or priced;\n\n•adverse legal developments relating to advertising or measurement tools;\n\n•changes in third-party policies, which may negatively impact the ability to measure, deliver and select ads to be served;\n\n•regulatory, legislative and industry developments relating to the collection and use of information and other privacy considerations, including regulations related to ad targeting and measurement tools;\n\n•any liability or reputational harm from advertisements shown on our service;\n\n•our relationship with third-party service providers for the management, sale and technology to support advertisements on our service;\n\n•the impact of our content and reputation on advertisers’ willingness to spend with us; and\n\n•any member dissatisfaction due to advertisements.\n\nThe ongoing coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic disrupted our business, increased our costs, led to delays in content releases and may again impact our business and results of operations.\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic and the various responses to it created significant volatility, uncertainty and economic disruption. Recently, there has been a return to more normal societal interactions, including the way we operate our business. We cannot predict the future impacts of this ongoing and any new pandemic(s), including: the duration and scope of such pandemic; governmental, business and individuals’ actions that may be taken in response; the effect on our members and consumer demand for and ability to pay for our services; disruptions or restrictions on our employees’ ability to work and travel; and any stoppages, disruptions or increased costs associated with our development, production, post-production, marketing and distribution of original programming. Future disruptions arising from the ongoing and any new pandemics could have a significant negative impact on our costs of doing business and otherwise negatively impact our results of operations.\n\nWe will continue to actively monitor the issues raised by the COVID-19 pandemic and may take further actions that alter our business operations, including content production, as may be required by federal, state, local or foreign authorities, or that we determine are in the best interests of our employees, members, partners and stockholders. It is not clear what the potential effects any such alterations or modifications may have on our business, including the effects on our members, suppliers or vendors, or on our financial results.\n\nIn addition to the potential direct impacts to our business, the global economy may continue to be impacted as a result of the actions taken in response to COVID-19. To the extent that such a weakened global economy impacts consumers’ ability or willingness to pay for our service or vendors’ ability to provide services to us, especially those related to our content productions, we could see our business and results of operations negatively impacted.\n\nRisks Related to Intellectual Property\n\nIf studios, content providers or other rights holders refuse to license streaming content or other rights upon terms acceptable to us, our business could be adversely affected.\n\nOur ability to provide our members with content they can enjoy depends on obtaining various rights from third parties upon terms acceptable to us, including necessary distribution rights, to such content and certain related elements thereof, such as the public performance of music contained within the content we distribute. The license periods and the terms and conditions of such rights vary. As content providers develop their own streaming services, they may be unwilling to provide us with access to certain content, including popular series or movies. If the studios, content providers and other rights holders are not or are no longer willing or able to license us content upon terms acceptable to us, our ability to stream content to our members may be adversely affected and/or our costs could increase. Certain licenses for content provide for the studios or other content providers to withdraw content from our service relatively quickly. Because of these provisions and other actions we may take, content available through our service can be withdrawn on short notice. As competition increases, we see the cost of certain programming increase. As we seek to differentiate our service, we are often focused on securing certain exclusive rights when obtaining content, including original content. We are also focused on programming an overall mix of content that\n\n8', 'Table of Contents\n\ndelights our members in a cost efficient manner. Within this context, we are selective about the titles we add and renew to our service. If we do not maintain a compelling mix of content, our member acquisition and retention may be adversely affected.\n\nMusic and certain authors’ performances contained within content we distribute may require us to obtain licenses for such distribution. In this regard, we engage in negotiations with collection management organizations (“CMOs”) and similar entities that hold certain rights to music and/or other interests in intellectual property (e.g. remuneration rights) in connection with streaming content into various territories. If we are unable to reach mutually acceptable terms with these organizations, we could become involved in litigation and/or could be enjoined from distributing certain content, which could adversely impact our business. Additionally, pending and ongoing litigation and negotiations between certain CMOs and other third parties in various territories could adversely impact our negotiations with CMOs, or result in music publishers represented by certain CMOs unilaterally withdrawing rights, and thereby adversely impact our ability to reach licensing agreements reasonably acceptable to us. Failure to reach such licensing agreements could expose us to potential liability for copyright infringement or otherwise increase our costs. Additionally, as the market for the digital distribution of content grows, a broader role for CMOs in the remuneration of authors, performers and other beneficiaries of neighboring rights could expose us to greater distribution expenses.\n\nIf our trademarks and other proprietary rights are not adequately protected to prevent use or appropriation by third parties, the value of our brand and other intangible assets may be diminished, and our business may be adversely affected.\n\nWe rely and expect to continue to rely on a combination of confidentiality and license agreements with our employees, consultants and third parties with whom we have relationships, as well as trademark, copyright, patent and trade secret protection laws, to protect our proprietary rights. We may also seek to enforce our proprietary rights through court proceedings or other legal actions. We have filed and we expect to file from time to time for trademark and patent applications. Nevertheless, these applications may not be approved, third parties may challenge any copyrights, patents or trademarks issued to or held by us, third parties may knowingly or unknowingly infringe our intellectual property rights, and we may not be able to prevent infringement or misappropriation without substantial expense to us. If the protection of our intellectual property rights is inadequate to prevent use or misappropriation by third parties, the value of our brand, content, and other intangible assets may be diminished, competitors may be able to more effectively mimic our service and methods of operations, the perception of our business and service to members and potential members may become confused in the marketplace, and our ability to attract members may be adversely affected.\n\nWe currently hold various domain names relating to our brand, including Netflix.com. Failure to protect our domain names could adversely affect our reputation and brand and make it more difficult for users to find our website and our service. We may be unable, without significant cost or at all, to prevent third parties from acquiring domain names that are similar to, infringe upon or otherwise decrease the value of our trademarks and other proprietary rights.\n\nIntellectual property claims against us could be costly and result in the loss of significant rights related to, among other things, our website, streaming technology, our recommendation and merchandising technology, title selection processes, our content, and marketing activities.\n\nTrademark, copyright, patent and other intellectual property rights are important to us and other companies. Our intellectual property rights extend to our technology, business processes and the content we produce and distribute through our service. We use the intellectual property of third parties in creating some of our content, merchandising our products and marketing our service. From time to time, third parties allege that we have infringed or otherwise violated their intellectual property rights. If we are unable to obtain sufficient rights, successfully defend our use, or develop non-infringing technology or otherwise alter our business practices on a timely basis in response to claims against us for infringement, misappropriation, misuse or other violation of third-party intellectual property rights, our business and competitive position may be adversely affected. Many companies are devoting significant resources to developing patents that could potentially affect many aspects of our business. There are numerous patents that broadly claim means and methods of conducting business on the internet. We have not searched patents relative to our technology. Defending ourselves against intellectual property claims, whether they are with or without merit or are determined in our favor, results in costly litigation and diversion of technical and management personnel. It also may result in our inability to use our current website, streaming technology, our recommendation and merchandising technology or inability to market our service or merchandise our products. We may also have to remove content from our service, or remove consumer products or marketing materials from the marketplace. As a result of a dispute, we may have to develop non-infringing technology, enter into royalty or licensing agreements, adjust our content, merchandising or marketing activities or take other actions to resolve the claims. These actions, if required, may be costly or unavailable on terms acceptable to us.\n\nRisks Related to Information Technology\n\n9', 'Table of Contents\n\nAny significant disruption in or unauthorized access to our computer systems or those of third parties that we utilize in our operations, including those relating to cybersecurity or arising from cyber-attacks, could result in a loss or degradation of service, unauthorized disclosure of data, including member and corporate information, or theft of intellectual property, including digital content assets, which could adversely impact our business.\n\nOur reputation and ability to attract, retain and serve our members is dependent upon the reliable performance and security of our computer systems and those of third parties that we utilize in our operations. These systems may be subject to damage or interruption from, among other things, earthquakes, adverse weather conditions, other natural disasters, terrorist attacks, rogue employees, power loss, telecommunications failures, and cybersecurity risks. Interruptions in these systems, or with the internet in general, could make our service unavailable or degraded or otherwise hinder our ability to deliver our service. Service interruptions, errors in our software or the unavailability of computer systems used in our operations could diminish the overall attractiveness of our service to existing and potential members.\n\nOur computer systems and those of third parties we use in our operations are subject to cybersecurity threats, including cyber-attacks such as computer viruses, denial of service attacks, physical or electronic break-ins and similar disruptions. These systems periodically experience directed attacks intended to lead to interruptions and delays in our service and operations as well as loss, misuse or theft of personal information (of third parties, employees, and our members) and other data, confidential information or intellectual property. Additionally, outside parties may attempt to induce employees, vendors, partners, or users to disclose sensitive or confidential information in order to gain access to data. Any attempt by hackers to obtain our data (including member and corporate information) or intellectual property (including digital content assets), disrupt our service, or otherwise access our systems, or those of third parties we use, if successful, could harm our business, be expensive to remedy and damage our reputation. We have implemented certain systems and processes to thwart hackers and protect our data and systems. However, the techniques used to gain unauthorized access to data and software are constantly evolving, and we may be unable to anticipate, detect or prevent unauthorized access or address all cybersecurity incidents that occur. Because of our prominence, we (and/or third parties we use) may be a particularly attractive target for such attacks, and from time to time, we have experienced an unauthorized release of certain digital content assets. However, to date these unauthorized releases have not had a material impact on our service, systems or business. There is no assurance that hackers may not have a material impact on our service or systems in the future. Our insurance does not cover expenses related to such disruptions or unauthorized access. Efforts to prevent hackers from disrupting our service or otherwise accessing our systems are expensive to develop, implement and maintain. These efforts require ongoing monitoring and updating as technologies change and efforts to overcome security measures become more sophisticated, and may limit the functionality of or otherwise negatively impact our service offering and systems. Any significant disruption to our service or access to our systems could result in a loss of members and adversely affect our business and results of operation. Further, a penetration of our systems or a third-party’s systems or other misappropriation or misuse of personal information could subject us to business, regulatory, litigation and reputation risk, which could have a negative effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\nWe utilize our own communications and computer hardware systems located either in our facilities or in that of a third-party provider. In addition, we utilize third-party “cloud” computing services in connection with our business operations. We also utilize our own and third-party content delivery networks to help us stream TV series, documentaries and feature films and offer mobile games in high volume to Netflix members over the internet. Problems faced by us or our third-party “cloud” computing or other network providers, including technological or business-related disruptions, as well as cybersecurity threats and regulatory interference, could adversely impact the experience of our members.\n\nWe rely upon Amazon Web Services to operate certain aspects of our service and any disruption of or interference with our use of the Amazon Web Services operation would impact our operations and our business would be adversely impacted.\n\nAmazon Web Services (“AWS”) provides a distributed computing infrastructure platform for business operations, or what is commonly referred to as a "cloud" computing service. We have architected our software and computer systems so as to utilize data processing, storage capabilities and other services provided by AWS. Currently, we run the vast majority of our computing on AWS. Given this, along with the fact that we cannot easily switch our AWS operations to another cloud provider, any disruption of or interference with our use of AWS would impact our operations and our business would be adversely impacted. While the retail side of Amazon competes with us, we do not believe that Amazon will use the AWS operation in such a manner as to gain competitive advantage against our service, although if it were to do so it could harm our business.\n\nIf the technology we use in operating our business fails, is unavailable, or does not operate to expectations, our business and results of operations could be adversely impacted.\n\nWe utilize a combination of proprietary and third-party technology to operate our business. This includes the technology that we have developed to recommend and merchandise content to our consumers as well as enable fast and efficient delivery of\n\n10', 'Table of Contents\n\ncontent to our members and their various consumer electronic devices. For example, we have built and deployed our own content-delivery network (“CDN”). To the extent Internet Service Providers (“ISPs”) do not interconnect with our CDN or charge us to access their networks, or if we experience difficulties in our CDN’s operation, our ability to efficiently and effectively deliver our streaming content to our members could be adversely impacted and our business and results of operations could be adversely affected. Likewise, if our recommendation and merchandising technology does not enable us to predict and recommend titles that our members will enjoy, our ability to attract and retain members may be adversely affected. We also utilize third-party technology to help market our service, process payments, and otherwise manage the daily operations of our business. If our technology or that of third-parties we utilize in our operations fails or otherwise operates improperly, including as a result of “bugs” or other errors in our development and deployment of software, our ability to operate our service, retain existing members and add new members may be impaired. Any harm to our members’ devices caused by software used in our operations could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\n\nChanges in how network operators handle and charge for access to data that travel across their networks could adversely impact our business.\n\nWe rely upon the ability of consumers to access our service through the internet. If network operators block, restrict or otherwise impair access to our service over their networks, our service and business could be negatively affected. To the extent that network operators implement usage based pricing, including meaningful bandwidth caps, or otherwise try to monetize access to their networks by data providers, we could incur greater operating expenses and our member acquisition and retention could be negatively impacted. Furthermore, to the extent network operators create tiers of internet access service and either charge us for or prohibit us from being available through these tiers, our business could be negatively impacted.\n\nMost network operators that provide consumers with access to the internet also provide these consumers with multichannel video programming. As such, many network operators have an incentive to use their network infrastructure in a manner adverse to our continued growth and success. While we believe that consumer demand, regulatory oversight and competition will help check these incentives, to the extent that network operators are able to provide preferential treatment to their data as opposed to ours or otherwise implement discriminatory network management practices, our business could be negatively impacted. The extent to which these incentives limit operator behavior differs across markets.\n\nRisks Related to Privacy\n\nPrivacy concerns could limit our ability to collect and leverage member personal information and other data and disclosure of member personal information and other data could adversely impact our business and reputation.\n\nIn the ordinary course of business and in particular in connection with content acquisition, merchandising our service to our members and our ad-supported subscription plan, we collect and utilize information supplied by our members, which may include personal information and other data. We are subject to laws, rules and regulations in the U.S. and in other countries relating to privacy and the collection, use and security of personal information, including but not limited to Regulation (EU) 2016/679 (also known as the General Data Protection Regulation or “GDPR”) and the California Privacy Rights Act ("CPRA"). Any actual or perceived failure to comply with the GDPR, the CCPA/CPRA, other data privacy laws or regulations, or related contractual or other obligations, or any perceived privacy rights violation, could lead to investigations, claims, and proceedings by governmental entities and private parties, damages for contract breach, and other significant costs, penalties, and other liabilities, as well as harm to our reputation and market position.\n\nOther businesses have been criticized by privacy groups and governmental bodies for attempts to link personal identities and other information to data collected on the internet regarding users’ browsing and other habits. Increased regulation of data utilization practices, including self-regulation or findings under existing laws that limit our ability to collect, transfer and use information and other data, could have an adverse effect on our business. In addition, if we were to disclose information and other data about our members in a manner that was objectionable to them, our business reputation could be adversely affected, and we could face potential legal claims that could impact our operating results. Internationally, we may become subject to additional and/or more stringent legal obligations concerning our treatment of member and other personal information, such as laws regarding data localization and/or restrictions on data export. Failure to comply with these obligations could subject us to liability, and to the extent that we need to alter our business model or practices to adapt to these obligations, we could incur additional expenses.\n\nOur reputation and relationships with members would be harmed if member personal information and other data, particularly billing data, were to be accessed by unauthorized persons.\n\nWe maintain personal information and other data regarding our members, including names, age, gender and billing information. This information and data is maintained on our own systems as well as that of third parties we use in our operations. With respect to billing information, such as credit card numbers, we rely on encryption and authentication\n\n11', 'Table of Contents\n\ntechnology to secure such information. We take measures to protect against unauthorized intrusion into our members’ information and other data. Despite these measures and technologies we, our payment processing services or other third-party services we use such as AWS, could experience an unauthorized intrusion into our members’ information and other data. In the event of such a breach, current and potential members may become unwilling to provide the information to us necessary for them to remain or become members. We also may be required to notify regulators about any actual or perceived data breach (including various state Attorneys General, one or more EU data protection authorities, or other data protection authorities) as well as the individuals who are affected by the incident within strict time periods. Additionally, we could face legal claims or regulatory fines or penalties for such a breach. The costs relating to any data breach could be material, and we currently do not carry insurance against the risk of a data breach. We also maintain personal information and other data concerning our employees, as well as personal information of others working on our productions. Should an unauthorized intrusion into our members’ or employees’ personal information and other data and/or production personal information occur, our business could be adversely affected and our larger reputation with respect to data protection could be negatively impacted.\n\nRisks Related to Liquidity\n\nThe long-term and largely fixed cost nature of our content commitments may limit our operating flexibility and could adversely affect our liquidity and results of operations.\n\nIn connection with licensing streaming content, we typically enter into multi-year commitments with studios and other content providers. We also enter into multi-year commitments for content that we produce, either directly or through third parties, including elements associated with these productions such as non-cancelable commitments under talent agreements. The payment terms of these agreements are not tied to member usage or the size of our membership base (“fixed cost”) but may be determined by costs of production or tied to such factors as titles licensed and/or theatrical exhibition receipts. Such commitments, to the extent estimable under accounting standards, are included in the Contractual Obligations section of Part II, Item 7, "Management\'s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" and Note 7, Commitments and Contingencies in the accompanying notes to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8, "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Given the multiple-year duration and largely fixed cost nature of content commitments, if business performance does not meet our expectations, our margins may be adversely impacted. Further, we may be unable to react to any reduction in our cash flows from operations, including those caused by a downturn in the economy, by reducing our streaming content obligations in the near-term. Payment terms for certain content commitments, such as content we directly produce, will typically require more up-front cash payments than other content licenses or arrangements whereby we do not cashflow the production of such content. To the extent membership and/or revenue growth do not meet our expectations, our liquidity and results of operations could be adversely affected as a result of content commitments and accelerated payment requirements of certain agreements. In addition, the long-term and largely fixed cost nature of our content commitments may limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to changes in our business and the market segments in which we operate. If we license and/or produce content that is not favorably received by consumers in a territory, or is unable to be shown in a territory, acquisition and retention may be adversely impacted and given the long-term and fixed cost nature of our content commitments, we may not be able to adjust our content offerings quickly and our results of operations may be adversely impacted.\n\nWe may seek additional capital that may result in stockholder dilution or that may have rights senior to those of our common stockholders.\n\nFrom time to time, we may seek to obtain additional capital, either through equity, equity-linked or debt securities. For several years prior to 2020, our cash flows from operations were negative and to the extent that it becomes negative in the future we may need to seek additional capital. The decision to obtain additional capital will depend on, among other things, our business plans, operating performance and condition of the capital markets. Rising interest rates or any disruption in the capital markets could make it more difficult and expensive for us to raise additional capital or refinance our existing indebtedness. If we raise additional funds through the issuance of equity, equity-linked or debt securities, those securities may have rights, preferences or privileges senior to the rights of our common stock, and our stockholders may experience dilution. Any large equity or equity-linked offering could also negatively impact our stock price.\n\nWe have a substantial amount of indebtedness and other obligations, including streaming content obligations, which could adversely affect our financial position, and we may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service our debt and other obligations.\n\nWe have a substantial amount of indebtedness and other obligations, including streaming content obligations. Moreover, we may incur additional indebtedness in the future and incur other obligations, including additional streaming content obligations. Our ability to make payments on our debt will depend on our financial and operating performance, which is subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions and to certain financial, business and other factors beyond our control. If we\n\n12', 'Table of Contents\n\nare unable to service our debt and other obligations from cash flows, we may need to refinance or restructure all or a portion of such obligations prior to maturity. If the financial markets become difficult or costly to access, including due to rising interest rates, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates or other changes in economic conditions, our ability to raise additional capital may be negatively impacted, and any refinancing or restructuring could be at higher interest rates and may require us to comply with more onerous covenants, which could further restrict our business operations. As of December\xa031, 2022, we had the equivalent of $14.4 billion aggregate principal amount of senior notes outstanding (“Notes”), some of which is denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. In addition, we have entered into a revolving credit agreement that provides for a $1 billion unsecured revolving credit facility. As of December\xa031, 2022, we have not borrowed any amount under this revolving credit facility. As of December\xa031, 2022, we had approximately $7.6 billion of total content liabilities as reflected on our consolidated balance sheet, some of which is denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Such amount does not include streaming content commitments that do not meet the criteria for liability recognition, the amounts of which are significant. For more information on our streaming content obligations, including those not on our consolidated balance sheet, see Note 7, Commitments and Contingencies in the accompanying notes to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8, "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Our substantial indebtedness and other obligations, including streaming content obligations, may:\n\n•make it difficult for us to satisfy our financial obligations, including making scheduled principal and interest payments on our Notes and our other obligations;\n\n•limit our ability to borrow additional funds, if needed, for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions or other general business purposes;\n\n•increase our cost of borrowing;\n\n•limit our ability to use our cash flow or obtain additional financing for future working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions or other general business purposes;\n\n•require us to use a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to make debt service payments and pay our other obligations when due;\n\n•limit our flexibility to plan for, or react to, changes in our business and industry;\n\n•place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our less leveraged competitors; and\n\n•increase our vulnerability to the impact of adverse economic and industry conditions, including changes in interest rates and foreign exchange rates.\n\nRisks Related to International Operations\n\nWe could be subject to economic, political, regulatory and other risks arising from our international operations.\n\nOperating in international markets requires significant resources and management attention and will subject us to economic, political, regulatory and other risks that may be different from or incremental to those in the U.S. In addition to the risks that we face in the U.S., our international operations involve risks that could adversely affect our business, including:\n\n•the need to adapt our content and user interfaces for specific cultural and language differences;\n\n•difficulties and costs associated with staffing and managing foreign operations;\n\n•political or social unrest, global hostilities, and economic instability;\n\n•compliance with laws such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, UK Bribery Act and other anti-corruption laws, export controls and economic sanctions, and local laws prohibiting corrupt payments to government officials;\n\n•difficulties in understanding and complying with local laws, regulations and customs in foreign jurisdictions, including local ownership requirements for streaming content providers;\n\n•regulatory requirements or government action against our service, whether in response to enforcement of actual or purported legal and regulatory requirements or otherwise, that results in disruption or non-availability of our service or particular content in the applicable jurisdiction;\n\n•foreign intellectual property laws, such as the EU copyright directive, or changes to such laws, which may be less favorable than U.S. law and, among other issues, may impact the economics of creating or distributing content, anti-piracy efforts, or our ability to protect or exploit intellectual property rights;\n\n•adverse tax consequences such as those related to changes in tax laws or tax rates or their interpretations, and the related application of judgment in determining our global provision for income taxes, deferred tax assets or liabilities or other tax liabilities given the ultimate tax determination is uncertain;\n\n•fluctuations in currency exchange rates, which have and may continue to impact revenues and expenses of our international operations and expose us to foreign currency exchange rate risk, which we do not currently hedge against but may do so in the future;\n\n•profit repatriation and other restrictions on the transfer of funds;\n\n13', 'Table of Contents\n\n•differing payment processing systems as well as consumer use and acceptance of electronic payment methods, such as payment cards;\n\n•new and different sources of competition;\n\n•censorship requirements that cause us to remove or edit popular content, leading to consumer disappointment, brand tarnishment or dissatisfaction with our service;\n\n•low usage and/or penetration of internet-connected consumer electronic devices;\n\n•different and more stringent user protection, data protection, privacy and other laws, including data localization and/or restrictions on data export, and local ownership requirements;\n\n•availability of reliable broadband connectivity and wide area networks in targeted areas for expansion;\n\n•differing, and often more lenient, laws and consumer understanding/attitudes regarding the illegality of piracy;\n\n•negative impacts from trade disputes; and\n\n•implementation of regulations designed to stimulate the local production of film and TV series in order to promote and preserve local culture and economic activity, including local content quotas, investment obligations, and levies to support local film funds. For example, the European Union revised its Audio Visual Media Services Directive in 2018 to require that European works comprise at least thirty percent (30%) of media service providers’ catalogs, and to require prominence of those works.\n\nThese and other factors may cause us to adjust our business plans, including expanding or ceasing certain operations in certain countries, and the execution of our strategies. Our failure to manage any of these risks successfully could harm our international operations and our overall business, and results of our operations.\n\nWe are subject to taxation related risks in multiple jurisdictions.\n\nWe are a U.S.-based multinational company subject to tax in multiple U.S. and foreign tax jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in determining our global provision for income taxes, deferred tax assets or liabilities and in evaluating our tax positions on a worldwide basis. While we believe our tax positions are consistent with the tax laws in the jurisdictions in which we conduct our business, it is possible that these positions may be challenged by jurisdictional tax authorities, which may have a significant impact on our global provision for taxes.\n\nTax laws are being re-examined and evaluated globally. New laws and interpretations of the law are taken into account for financial statement purposes in the quarter or year that they become applicable. Tax authorities are increasingly scrutinizing the tax positions of companies and we have tax audits pending in several jurisdictions. The U.S. federal and state governments, countries in the European Union, as well as a number of other countries and organizations such as the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, are actively considering changes to existing tax laws that, if enacted, could increase our tax obligations in jurisdictions where we do business. If U.S. or other foreign tax authorities change applicable tax laws or successfully challenge how or where our profits are currently recognized, our overall taxes could increase, and our business, financial condition or results of operations may be adversely impacted.\n\nRisks Related to Human Resources\n\nWe may lose key employees or may be unable to hire qualified employees, and the failure to maintain and improve our company culture may adversely affect our business.\n\nWe rely on the continued service of our senior management, including our Co-Chief Executive Officers, Ted Sarandos and Greg Peters, our Executive Chairman, Reed Hastings, members of our executive team and other key employees and the hiring of new qualified employees. In our industry, there is substantial and continuous competition for highly-skilled business, product development, technical, creative and other personnel. If we experience high executive turnover, fail to adapt our business practices to industry expectations, fail to implement succession plans for key employees, encounter difficulties associated with the transition of members of our management team, are not successful in recruiting new personnel or in retaining and motivating existing personnel, in instilling our culture in new employees, or maintaining and improving our culture as we grow, our operations may be disrupted, which could adversely affect our results of operations.\n\nLabor disputes may have an adverse effect on the Company’s business.\n\nOur partners, suppliers, vendors and we employ the services of writers, directors, actors and other talent as well as trade employees and others who are subject to collective bargaining agreements in the motion picture industry, both in the U.S. and internationally. Expiring collective bargaining agreements may be renewed on terms that are unfavorable to us. If expiring collective bargaining agreements cannot be renewed, then it is possible that the affected unions could take action in the form of strikes or work stoppages. Such actions, as well as higher costs or operating complexities in connection with these collective bargaining agreements or a significant labor dispute, could have an adverse effect on our business by causing delays in\n\n14', 'Table of Contents\n\nproduction, added costs or by reducing profit margins, and our ability to provide new content to our members could likewise be delayed or dropped.\n\nRisks Related to Our Stock Ownership\n\nProvisions in our charter documents and under Delaware law could discourage a takeover that stockholders may consider favorable, although we have announced plans to modify some of these provisions over time.\n\nOur charter documents in their current form may discourage, delay or prevent a merger or acquisition that a stockholder may consider favorable because they:\n\n•authorize our board of directors, without stockholder approval, to issue up to 10,000,000 shares of undesignated preferred stock;\n\n•provide for a classified board of directors until our annual meeting of stockholders held in 2025;\n\n•prohibit our stockholders from acting by written consent; and\n\n•establish advance notice requirements for proposing matters to be approved by stockholders at stockholder meetings.\n\nAs a Delaware corporation, we are also subject to certain Delaware anti-takeover provisions. Under Delaware law, a corporation may not engage in a business combination with any holder of 15% or more of its capital stock unless the holder has held the stock for three years or, among other things, the board of directors has approved the transaction. Our board of directors could rely on Delaware law to prevent or delay an acquisition of us.\n\nIn addition, a merger or acquisition may trigger retention payments to certain executive employees under the terms of our Amended and Restated Executive Severance and Retention Incentive Plan, thereby increasing the cost of such a transaction.\n\nOur stock price is volatile.\n\nThe price at which our common stock has traded has fluctuated significantly. The price may continue to be volatile due to a number of factors including the following, some of which are beyond our control:\n\n•variations in our operating results, including our membership acquisition and retention, revenues, operating income, net income, net cash provided by operating activities and free cash flow;\n\n•variations between our actual operating results and the expectations of securities analysts, investors and the financial community;\n\n•announcements of developments affecting our business, systems or expansion plans by us or others;\n\n•competition, including the introduction of new competitors, their pricing strategies and services;\n\n•market volatility in general;\n\n•the level of demand for our stock, including the amount of short interest in our stock;\n\n•the impact of our current stock repurchase program and any future stock repurchase program we may adopt;\n\n•the operating results of our competitors; and\n\n•other risks and uncertainties described in these risk factors.\n\nAs a result of these and other factors, investors in our common stock may not be able to resell their shares at or above their original purchase price.\n\nFollowing certain periods of volatility in the market price of our securities, we became the subject of securities litigation. We may experience more such litigation following future periods of volatility. This type of litigation may result in substantial costs and a diversion of management’s attention and resources.\n\nPreparing and forecasting our financial results requires us to make judgments and estimates which may differ materially from actual results.\n\nGiven the dynamic nature of our business, and the inherent limitations in predicting the future, forecasts of our revenues, operating margins, net income and other financial and operating data may differ materially from actual results. Also, predicting consumer adoption of various pricing strategies, such as the ad-supported subscription plan or efforts to limit multi-household usage, and new revenue streams, such as advertising revenue, is inherently difficult given the lack of operating history with respect to such offerings, and actual results may differ significantly from the expectations of our management, securities analysts or investors. Such discrepancies could cause a decline in the trading price of our common stock. In addition, the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United\n\n15', 'Table of Contents\n\nStates of America also requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported periods. We base such estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, but actual results may differ from these estimates. For example, we estimate the content amortization pattern, beginning with the month of first availability, of any particular licensed or produced television series, documentary or feature film based upon various factors including historical and estimated viewing patterns. If actual viewing patterns differ from these estimates, the pattern and/or period of amortization would be changed and could affect the timing or recognition of content amortization. If we revise such estimates it could result in greater in-period expenses, which could cause us to miss our earnings guidance or negatively impact the results we report which could negatively impact our stock price. Further, events outside of our control may cause actual results to differ from our forecast. For example, the COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted historical acquisition and retention patterns, and has made forecasting more difficult.\n\nItem 1B.Unresolved Staff Comments\n\nNone.\n\n16', 'Table of Contents\n\nItem 2.Properties\n\nWe have leased principal properties in both Los Gatos, California, which is the location of our corporate headquarters, and in Los Angeles, California.

The increase in average monthly revenue per paying membership resulted from our price changes, partially offset by the strengthening of the U.S. dollar relative to certain foreign currencies.\n\nThe decrease in operating margin is primarily due to revenues growing at a slower rate as compared to the 15% increase in content amortization. Revenue growth during the year was impacted by fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, while content amortization increased as a result of delays in content releases due to the COVID-19 pandemic impacting the comparable prior year period.\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic and the various responses to it created significant volatility, uncertainty and economic disruption. Recently, there has been a return to more normal societal interactions, including the way we operate our business. We cannot predict the future impacts of this ongoing and any new pandemic(s). See Part I, Item IA: "Risk Factors" in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional details.\n\nStreaming Revenues\n\nWe derive revenues from monthly membership fees for services related to streaming content to our members. We offer a variety of streaming membership plans, the price of which varies by country and the features of the plan. As of December 31, 2022, pricing on our paid plans ranged from the U.S. dollar equivalent of $1 to $26 per month. We expect that from time to time the prices of our membership plans in each country may change and we may test other plan and price variations.\n\nThe following tables summarize streaming revenue and

the right to receive Netflix service following sign-up and a method of payment being provided, and that is not part of a free trial or certain other promotions that may be offered by the Company to new or rejoining members. Certain members have the option to add extra member sub accounts. These extra member sub accounts are not included in paid memberships. A membership is canceled and ceases to be reflected in the above metrics as of the effective cancellation date. Voluntary cancellations generally become effective at the end of the prepaid membership period. Involuntary cancellations, as a result of a failed method of payment, become effective immediately. Memberships are assigned to territories based on the geographic location used at time of sign-up as determined by the Company’s internal systems, which utilize industry standard geo-location technology.\n\n(2) We believe constant currency information is useful in analyzing the underlying trends in average monthly revenue per paying membership. In order to exclude the effect of foreign currency rate fluctuations on average monthly revenue per paying membership, we estimate current period revenue assuming foreign exchange rates had remained constant with foreign exchange rates from each of the corresponding months of the prior-year period. For the year ended December\xa031, 2022, our revenues would have been approximately $1,773\xa0million higher had foreign currency exchange rates remained constant with those for the year ended December\xa031, 2021.\n\nCost of Revenues\n\nAmortization of content assets makes up the majority of cost of revenues. Expenses directly associated with the acquisition, licensing and production of content (such as payroll and related personnel expenses, costs associated with obtaining rights to music included in our content, overall deals with talent, miscellaneous production related costs and participations and residuals), streaming delivery costs and other operations costs make up the remainder of cost of revenues. We have built our own global content delivery network (“Open Connect”) to help us efficiently stream a high volume of content to our members over the internet. Delivery expenses, therefore, include equipment costs related to Open Connect, payroll and related personnel expenses and all third-party costs, such as cloud computing costs, associated with delivering content over the internet. Other operations costs include customer service and payment processing fees, including those we pay to our integrated payment partners, as well as other costs directly incurred in making our content available to members.\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|  | | |  | | | Year Ended December 31, | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |  | | | Change | | | | | | | | |\n|  | | |  | | | 2022 | | |  | | | 2021 | | |  | | | 2020 | | |  | | | 2022 vs. 2021 | | | | | | | | |\n|  | | |  | | | (in\xa0thousands,\xa0except\xa0percentages) | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |\n| Cost of revenues | | |  | | | $ | 19,168,285 |  |  | | | $ | 17,332,683 |  |  | | | $ | 15,276,319 |  |  | | | $ | 1,835,602 |  |  | | | 11 | | % |\n| As a percentage of revenues | | |  | | | 61 | | % |  | | | 58 | | % |  | | | 61 | | % |  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |\n\nThe increase in cost of revenues for the year ended December\xa031, 2022 as compared to the year ended December\xa031, 2021 was primarily due to a $1,796 million increase in content amortization relating to our existing and new content, including more exclusive and original programming.\n\nMarketing\n\nMarketing expenses consist primarily of advertising expenses and certain payments made to our marketing partners, including consumer electronics ("CE") manufacturers, multichannel video programming distributors ("MVPDs"), mobile operators and ISPs.

The foreign exchange gain in the year ended December\xa031, 2022 was primarily driven by the non-cash $353 million gain from the remeasurement of our Senior Notes denominated in euros, partially offset by the remeasurement of cash and content liability positions in currencies other than the functional currencies.

The mandatory capitalization requirement increases our deferred tax assets and cash tax liabilities.\n\nOn August 16, 2022, Congress passed the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022. The tax provisions most applicable to us are the newly introduced 15% corporate alternative minimum tax on book income and 1% excise tax on stock repurchases, which are both effective January 1, 2023. While we do not anticipate these changes to be significant, they could impact our consolidated financial position and we will continue to monitor as new information and guidance becomes available.\n\n24', 'Table of Contents\n\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|  | | | Year Ended December\xa031, | | | | | | | | |  | | | Change | | | | | |\n|  | | | 2022 | | |  | | | 2021 | | |  | | | 2022 vs. 2021 | | | | | |\n|  | | | (in\xa0thousands,\xa0except\xa0percentages) | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |\n| Cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and short-term investments | | | $ | 6,081,858 |  |  | | | $ | 6,055,111 |  |  | | | $ | 26,747 |  | — | | % |\n| Short-term and long-term debt | | | 14,353,076 | |  |  | | | 15,392,895 | |  |  | | | (1,039,819) | |  | (7) | | % |\n\nCash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and short-term investments increased $27 million in the year ended December\xa031, 2022 primarily due to cash provided by operations, partially offset by acquisitions, the repayment of debt and purchases of property and equipment.\n\nDebt, net of debt issuance costs, decreased $1,040 million primarily due to the repayment upon maturity of the $700 million aggregate principal amount of our 5.500% Senior Notes in February 2022, coupled with the remeasurement of our euro-denominated notes. The amount of principal and interest due in the next twelve months is $682\xa0million. The amount of principal and interest due beyond the next twelve months is $17,529\xa0million. As of\xa0December\xa031, 2022, no amounts had been borrowed under our $1 billion Revolving Credit Agreement. See Note 6 Debt in the accompanying notes to our consolidated financial statements.\n\nWe anticipate that our future capital needs from the debt market will be more limited compared to prior years. Our ability to obtain this or any additional financing that we may choose to, or need to, obtain will depend on, among other things, our development efforts, business plans, operating performance and the condition of the capital markets at the time we seek financing. We may not be able to obtain such financing on terms acceptable to us or at all. If we raise additional funds through the issuance of equity or debt securities, those securities may have rights, preferences or privileges senior to the rights of our common stock, and our stockholders may experience dilution.\n\nIn March 2021, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $5\xa0billion of our common stock, with no expiration date. Stock repurchases may be effected through open market repurchases in compliance with Rule 10b-18 under the Exchange Act, including through the use of trading plans intended to qualify under Rule 10b5-1 under the Exchange Act, privately-negotiated transactions, accelerated stock repurchase plans, block purchases, or other similar purchase techniques and in such amounts as management deems appropriate. We are not obligated to repurchase any specific number of shares, and the timing and actual number of shares repurchased will depend on a variety of factors, including our stock price, general economic, business and market conditions, and alternative investment opportunities. We may discontinue any repurchases of our common stock at any time without prior notice. As of December\xa031, 2022, the Company has repurchased 1,182,410 shares of common stock for an aggregate amount of $600\xa0million. As of December\xa031, 2022, $4.4\xa0billion remains available for repurchases.\n\nOur primary uses of cash include the acquisition, licensing and production of content, marketing programs, streaming delivery and personnel-related costs, as well as for strategic acquisitions and investments. Cash payment terms for non-original content have historically been in line with the amortization period. Investments in original content, and in particular content that we produce and own, require more cash upfront relative to licensed content. For example, production costs are paid as the content is created, well in advance of when the content is available on the service and amortized. We expect to continue to significantly invest in global content, particularly in original content, which will impact our liquidity. We currently anticipate that cash flows from operations, available funds and access to financing sources, including our revolving credit facility, will continue to be sufficient to meet our cash needs for the next twelve months and beyond.\n\nOur material cash requirements from known contractual and other obligations primarily relate to our content, debt and lease obligations. As of December 31, 2022, the expected timing of those payments are as follows:\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| Obligations (in thousands): | | |  | | | Total | | |  | | | Next 12 Months | | |  | | | Beyond 12 Months | | |\n| Content\xa0obligations\xa0(1) | | |  | | | $ | 21,831,947 |  |  | | | $ | 10,038,483 |  |  | | | $ | 11,793,464 |  |\n| Debt (2) | | |  | | | 18,210,739 | |  |  | | | 681,993 | |  |  | | | 17,528,746 | |  |\n| Operating lease obligations (3) | | |  | | | 3,363,091 | |  |  | | | 477,451 | |  |  | | | 2,885,640 | |  |\n| Total | | |  | | | $ | 43,405,777 |  |  | | | $ | 11,197,927 |  |  | | | $ | 32,207,850 |  |\n\n25', 'Table of Contents\n\n(1)As of December\xa031, 2022, content obligations were comprised of $4.5 billion included in "Current content liabilities" and $3.1 billion of "Non-current content liabilities" on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and $14.2 billion of obligations that are not reflected on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as they did not then meet the criteria for recognition.\n\nContent obligations include amounts related to the acquisition, licensing and production of content. An obligation for the production of content includes non-cancelable commitments under creative talent and employment agreements and other production related commitments. An obligation for the acquisition and licensing of content is incurred at the time we enter into an agreement to obtain future titles. Once a title becomes available, a content liability is recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Certain agreements include the obligation to license rights for unknown future titles, the ultimate quantity and/or fees for which are not yet determinable as of the reporting date. Traditional film output deals, or certain TV series license agreements where the number of seasons to be aired is unknown, are examples of these types of agreements. The contractual obligations table above does not include any estimated obligation for the unknown future titles, payment for which could range from less than one year to more than five years. However, these unknown obligations are expected to be significant and we believe could include approximately $1 billion to $4 billion over the next three years, with the payments for the vast majority of such amounts expected to occur after the next twelve months. The foregoing range is based on considerable management judgments and the actual amounts may differ. Once we know the title that we will receive and the license fees, we include the amount in the contractual obligations table above.\n\n(2)Debt obligations include our Notes consisting of principal and interest payments. See Note 6 Debt in the accompanying notes to our consolidated financial statements for further details.\n\n(3)See Note 5 Balance Sheet Components in the accompanying notes to our consolidated financial statements for further details regarding leases. As of December\xa031, 2022, the Company has additional operating leases for real estate that have not yet commenced of $419\xa0million which has been included above. Total lease obligations as of December\xa031, 2022 decreased $153\xa0million from $3,516\xa0million as of December\xa031, 2021 to $3,363\xa0million as of December\xa031, 2022 due to payments made on lease liabilities.\n\nIn addition, as of December\xa031, 2022, we had gross unrecognized tax benefits of $227\xa0million, of which $155\xa0million was classified in “Other non-current liabilities" in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. At this time, an estimate of the range of reasonably possible adjustments to the balance of unrecognized tax benefits cannot be made.\n\nFree Cash Flow\n\nWe define free cash flow as cash provided by (used in) operating activities less purchases of property and equipment and change in other assets. We believe free cash flow is an important liquidity metric because it measures, during a given period, the amount of cash generated that is available to repay debt obligations, make strategic acquisitions and investments and for certain other activities like stock repurchases. Free cash flow is considered a non-GAAP financial measure and should not be considered in isolation of, or as a substitute for, net income, operating income, net cash provided by operating activities, or any other measure of financial performance or liquidity presented in accordance with GAAP.\n\nIn assessing liquidity in relation to our results of operations, we compare free cash flow to net income, noting that the major recurring differences are excess content payments over amortization, non-cash stock-based compensation expense, non-cash remeasurement gain/loss on our euro-denominated debt, and other working capital differences. Working capital differences include deferred revenue, excess property and equipment purchases over depreciation, taxes and semi-annual interest payments on our outstanding debt. Our receivables from members generally settle quickly.\n\n26', 'Table of Contents\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|  | | | Year Ended December\xa031, | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |  | | | Change | | | | | |\n|  | | | 2022 | | |  | | | 2021 | | |  | | | 2020 | | |  | | | 2022 vs. 2021 | | | | | |\n|  | | | (in thousands) | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |\n| Net cash provided by operating activities | | | $ | 2,026,257 |  |  | | | $ | 392,610 |  |  | | | $ | 2,427,077 |  |  | | | $ | 1,633,647 |  | 416 | | % |\n| Net cash used in investing activities | | | (2,076,392) | |  |  | | | (1,339,853) | |  |  | | | (505,354) | |  |  | | | 736,539 | |  | 55 | | % |\n| Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities | | | (664,254) | |  |  | | | (1,149,776) | |  |  | | | 1,237,311 | |  |  | | | (485,522) | |  | (42) | | % |\n|  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |\n| Non-GAAP reconciliation of free cash flow: | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |\n| Net cash provided by operating activities | | | 2,026,257 | |  |  | | | 392,610 | |  |  | | | 2,427,077 | |  |  | | | 1,633,647 | |  | 416 | | % |\n| Purchases of property and equipment | | | (407,729) | |  |  | | | (524,585) | |  |  | | | (497,923) | |  |  | | | (116,856) | |  | (22) | | % |\n| Change in other assets | | | — | |  |  | | | (26,919) | |  |  | | | (7,431) | |  |  | | | 26,919 | |  | 100 | | % |\n| Free cash flow | | | $ | 1,618,528 |  |  | | | $ | (158,894) |  |  | | | $ | 1,921,723 |  |  | | | $ | 1,777,422 |  | 1119 | | % |\n\nNet cash provided by operating activities increased $1,634 million from the year ended December\xa031, 2021 to $2,026 million for the year ended December\xa031, 2022 primarily driven by a $1,918 million or 6% increase in revenues, coupled with a decrease in cash payments for content assets. The payments for content assets decreased $810 million, from $17,469 million to $16,660 million, or 5%, as compared to the increase in the amortization of content assets of $1,796 million, from $12,230 million to $14,026 million, or 15%. In addition, we had increased payments associated with higher operating expenses, primarily related to increased personnel costs to support our continued improvements in our streaming service and our international expansion.\n\nNet cash used in investing activities increased $737 million, primarily due to purchases of short-term investments.\n\nNet cash used in financing activities decreased $486 million primarily due to there being no repurchases of common stock in the year ended December\xa031, 2022 as compared to repurchases of common stock for an aggregate amount of $600\xa0million in the year ended December\xa031, 2021, partially offset by the repayment upon maturity of the $700\xa0million aggregate principal amount of our 5.500% Senior Notes in February 2022 as compared to the repayment upon maturity of the $500\xa0million aggregate principal amount of our 5.375% Senior Notes in February 2021.\n\nFree cash flow was $2,873 million lower than net income for the year ended December\xa031, 2022 primarily due to $2,634 million of cash payments for content assets over amortization expense, $353 million of non-cash remeasurement gain on our euro-denominated debt, and $461\xa0million other non-favorable working capital differences, partially offset by $575 million of non-cash stock-based compensation expenses.\n\nFree cash flow was $5,275\xa0million lower than net income for the year ended December\xa031, 2021 primarily due to $5,239\xa0million of cash payments for content assets over amortization expense, $431\xa0million of non-cash remeasurement gain on our euro-denominated debt and $8\xa0million other non-favorable working capital differences, partially offset by $403\xa0million of non-cash stock-based compensation expenses.\n\nIndemnifications\n\nThe information set forth under Note 8 Guarantees - Indemnification Obligations in the accompanying notes to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8, "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K is incorporated herein by reference.\n\nCritical Accounting Estimates\n\nThe preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported periods. The Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") has defined a company’s critical accounting policies as the ones that are most important to the portrayal of a company’s financial condition and results of operations, and which require a company to make its most difficult and subjective judgments. Based on this definition, we have identified the critical accounting policies and judgments addressed below. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates.\n\n27', 'Table of Contents\n\nContent\n\nWe acquire, license and produce content, including original programming, in order to offer our members unlimited viewing of video entertainment. The content licenses are for a fixed fee and specific windows of availability. Payment terms for certain content licenses and the production of content require more upfront cash payments relative to the amortization expense. Payments for content, including additions to content assets and the changes in related liabilities, are classified within "Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities" on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.\n\nWe recognize content assets (licensed and produced) as "Content assets, net" on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. For licensed content, we capitalize the fee per title and record a corresponding liability at the gross amount of the liability when the license period begins, the cost of the title is known and the title is accepted and available for streaming. For produced content, we capitalize costs associated with the production, including development cost, direct costs and production overhead. Participations and residuals are expensed in line with the amortization of production costs.\n\nBased on factors including historical and estimated viewing patterns, we amortize the content assets (licensed and produced) in “Cost of revenues” on the Consolidated Statements of Operations over the shorter of each title\'s contractual window of availability or estimated period of use or ten years, beginning with the month of first availability. The amortization is on an accelerated basis, as we typically expect more upfront viewing, and film amortization is more accelerated than TV series amortization. On average, over 90% of a licensed or produced content asset is expected to be amortized within four years after its month of first availability. We review factors that impact the amortization of the content assets on a regular basis. Our estimates related to these factors require considerable management judgment.\n\nIn the normal course of business, we, or a third-party producing content on our behalf, may qualify for tax incentives through eligible spend on productions. The accounting for tax incentives is dependent on the particular type of incentive, including the nature of the benefit and the location the incentive is earned. In general, tax incentives are realized as cash receipts and may be received prior to or after a title launches on our service. Upon a title’s launch, any amounts we are eligible for through qualified production spend but have not received, are recognized in “Other current assets” or “Other non-current assets” on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as receivables. Tax incentives are generally accounted for as a reduction to the cost basis of content assets (presented in “Content assets, net”) and reduces content amortization over the life of the title (as presented in “Cost of revenues”) on the Consolidated Statement of Operations.\n\nOur business model is subscription based as opposed to a model generating revenues at a specific title level. Content assets (licensed and produced) are predominantly monetized as a group and therefore are reviewed at a group level when an event or change in circumstances indicates a change in the expected usefulness of the content or that the fair value may be less than unamortized cost. To date, we have not identified any such event or changes in circumstances. If such changes are identified in the future, these aggregated content assets will be stated at the lower of unamortized cost or fair value. In addition, unamortized costs for assets that have been, or are expected to be, abandoned are written off.\n\nIncome Taxes\n\nWe record a provision for income taxes for the anticipated tax consequences of our reported results of operations using the asset and liability method. Deferred income taxes are recognized by applying enacted statutory tax rates applicable to future years to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases as well as net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. The measurement of deferred tax assets is reduced, if necessary, by a valuation allowance for any tax benefits for which future realization is uncertain.\n\nAlthough we believe our assumptions, judgments and estimates are reasonable, changes in tax laws or our interpretation of tax laws and the resolution of any tax audits could significantly impact the amounts provided for income taxes in our consolidated financial statements.\n\nIn evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets, in full or in part, we consider all available positive and negative evidence, including our past operating results, and our forecast of future earnings, future taxable income and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies. The assumptions utilized in determining future taxable income require significant judgment and are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying business. Actual operating results in future years could differ from our current assumptions, judgments and estimates. However, we believe that it is more likely than not that most of the deferred tax assets recorded on our Consolidated Balance Sheets will ultimately be realized. We record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the net amount that we believe is more likely than not to be realized. As of December\xa031, 2022 the valuation allowance of $343 million was related to the California research and development credits and certain foreign tax attributes that we do not expect to realize.\n\nWe did not recognize certain tax benefits from uncertain tax positions within the provision for income taxes. We may recognize a tax benefit only if it is more likely than not the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing\n\n28', 'Table of Contents\n\nauthorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such positions are then measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon settlement. At December\xa031, 2022, our estimated gross unrecognized tax benefits were $227 million of which $155 million, if recognized, would favorably impact our future earnings. Due to uncertainties in any tax audit outcome, our estimates of the ultimate settlement of our unrecognized tax positions may change and the actual tax benefits may differ significantly from the estimates.\n\nSee Note 10 Income Taxes to the consolidated financial statements for further information regarding income taxes.\n\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\n\nThe information set forth under Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements under the caption “Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” is incorporated herein by reference.\n\nItem 7A.Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk\n\nWe are exposed to market risks related to interest rate changes and the corresponding changes in the market values of our debt and foreign currency fluctuations.\n\nInterest Rate Risk\n\nAt December\xa031, 2022, our cash equivalents and short-term investments were generally invested in money market funds and time deposits. Interest paid on such funds fluctuates with the prevailing interest rate.\n\nAs of December\xa031, 2022, we had $14.4 billion of debt, consisting of fixed rate unsecured debt in fourteen tranches due between 2024 and 2030. Refer to Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements for details about all issuances. The fair value of our debt will fluctuate with movements of interest rates, increasing in periods of declining rates of interest and declining in periods of increasing rates of interest. The fair value of our debt will also fluctuate based on changes in foreign currency rates, as discussed below.\n\nForeign Currency Risk\n\nCurrencies denominated in other than the U.S. dollar account for 56% of revenue for the year ended December\xa031, 2022. We therefore have foreign currency risk related to these currencies, which are primarily the euro, the British pound, the Brazilian real, the Canadian dollar, the Mexican peso, the Australian dollar, and the Japanese yen.\n\nAccordingly, changes in exchange rates, and in particular a weakening of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar may negatively affect our revenue and operating income as expressed in U.S. dollars. For the year ended December\xa031, 2022, our revenues would have been approximately $1,773 million higher had foreign currency exchange rates remained constant with those for the year ended December\xa031, 2021.\n\nWe have also experienced and will continue to experience fluctuations in our net income as a result of gains (losses) on the settlement and the remeasurement of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies that are not the functional currency. In the year ended December\xa031, 2022, we recognized a $282\xa0million foreign exchange gain primarily due to the non-cash remeasurement of our Senior Notes denominated in euros, partially offset by the remeasurement of cash and content liability positions denominated in currencies other than functional currencies.\n\nIn addition, the effect of exchange rate changes on cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash in the year ended December\xa031, 2022 was a decrease of $170 million.\n\nWe do not use foreign exchange contracts or derivatives to hedge any foreign currency exposures. The volatility of exchange rates depends on many factors that we cannot forecast with reliable accuracy. Our continued international expansion increases our exposure to exchange rate fluctuations and as a result, such fluctuations could have a significant impact on our future results of operations.\n\nItem 8.Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\n\nThe consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes listed in Part IV, Item\xa015(a)(1) of this Annual Report on Form 10-K are included immediately following Part IV hereof and incorporated by reference herein.\n\nItem 9.Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure\n\nNone.\n\n29', 'Table of Contents\n\nItem 9A.Controls and Procedures\n\n(a)Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\n\nOur management, with the participation of our co-Chief Executive Officers and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Based on that evaluation, our co-Chief Executive Officers and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K were effective in providing reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission’s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our co-Chief Executive Officers and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures.\n\nOur management, including our co-Chief Executive Officers and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal controls will prevent all error and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within Netflix have been detected.\n\n(b)Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\n\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) of the Exchange Act.) Our management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December\xa031, 2022. In making this assessment, our management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (“COSO”) in Internal Control—Integrated Framework (2013 framework). Based on our assessment under the framework in Internal Control—Integrated Framework (2013 framework), our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December\xa031, 2022. The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December\xa031, 2022 has been audited by Ernst & Young LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report that is included herein.\n\n(c)Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\n\nThere was no change in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended December\xa031, 2022 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\n\n30', 'Table of Contents\n\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\n\nTo the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of Netflix, Inc.\n\nOpinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\n\nWe have audited Netflix, Inc.’s internal control over financial reporting as of December\xa031, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). In our opinion, Netflix, Inc. (the Company) maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December\xa031, 2022, based on the COSO criteria.\n\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of December\xa031, 2022 and 2021, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, stockholders’ equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December\xa031, 2022, and the related notes and our report dated January\xa026, 2023 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.\n\nBasis for Opinion\n\nThe Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\n\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.\n\nOur audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\n\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\n\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\n\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|  | | | /s/ Ernst & Young LLP | | |\n| San Jose, California | | |  | | |\n| January 26, 2023 | | |  | | |\n\n31', 'Table of Contents\n\nItem 9B.Other Information\n\nNone.\n\nItem 9C.Disclosure Regarding Foreign Jurisdictions that Prevent Inspections\n\nNot applicable.\n\n32', 'Table of Contents\n\nPART III\n\nItem 10.Directors, Executive Officers and Corporate Governance\n\nInformation regarding our directors and executive officers is incorporated by reference from the information contained under the sections “Proposal One: Election of Directors,” and “Code of Ethics” in our Proxy Statement for the Annual Meeting of Stockholders.\n\nItem 11.Executive Compensation\n\nInformation required by this item is incorporated by reference from information contained under the sections “Compensation Discussion and Analysis” and “Compensation of Named Executive Officers and Other Matters” in our Proxy Statement for the Annual Meeting of Stockholders.\n\nItem 12.Security Ownership of Certain Beneficial Owners and Management and Related Stockholder Matters\n\nInformation required by this item is incorporated by reference from information contained under the sections “Security Ownership of Certain Beneficial Owners and Management” and “Equity Compensation Plan Information” in our Proxy Statement for the Annual Meeting of Stockholders.\n\nItem 13.Certain Relationships and Related Transactions, and Director Independence\n\nInformation required by this item is incorporated by reference from information contained under the section “Certain Relationships and Related Transactions” and “Director Independence” in our Proxy Statement for the Annual Meeting of Stockholders.\n\nItem 14.Principal Accountant Fees and Services\n\nInformation with respect to principal independent registered public accounting firm fees and services is incorporated by reference from the information under the caption “Proposal Two: Ratification of Appointment of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm” in our Proxy Statement for the Annual Meeting of Stockholders.\n\n33', 'Table of Contents\n\nPART IV\n\nItem 15.Exhibits, Financial Statement Schedules\n\n(a)The following documents are filed as part of this Annual Report on Form 10-K:\n\n(1)Financial Statements:\n\nThe financial statements are filed as part of this Annual Report on Form 10-K under “Item 8.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at December\xa031, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December\xa031, 2022, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.\n\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December\xa031, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) and our report dated January\xa026, 2023 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.\n\nBasis for Opinion\n\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\n\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\n\nCritical Audit Matter\n\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective or complex judgments. The communication of the critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\n\n36', "Table of Contents\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|  | | | Content Amortization | | |\n| Description of the Matter | | | As disclosed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements “Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies”, the Company acquires, licenses and produces content, including original programming (“Content”). The Company amortizes Content based on factors including historical and estimated viewing patterns.  Auditing the amortization of the Company’s Content is complex and subjective due to the judgmental nature of amortization which is based on an estimate of future viewing patterns. Estimated viewing patterns are based on historical and forecasted viewing. If actual viewing patterns differ from these estimates, the pattern and/or period of amortization would be changed and could affect the timing of recognition of content amortization. | | |\n|  | | |  | | |\n| How We Addressed the  Matter in Our Audit | | | We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over the content amortization process. For example, we tested controls over management’s review of the content amortization method and the significant assumptions, including the historical and forecasted viewing hour consumption, used to develop estimated viewing patterns. We also tested management’s controls to determine that the data used in the model was complete and accurate.  To test content amortization, our audit procedures included, among others, evaluating the content amortization method, testing the significant assumptions used to develop the estimated viewing patterns and testing the completeness and accuracy of the underlying data. For example, we assessed management’s assumptions by comparing them to current viewing trends and current operating information including comparing previous estimates of viewing patterns to actual results. We also performed sensitivity analyses to evaluate the potential changes in the content amortization recorded that could result from changes in the assumptions. | | |\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- |

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\n1.Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\n\nDescription of Business\n\nNetflix, Inc. (the “Company”) was incorporated on August\xa029, 1997 and began operations on April\xa014, 1998. The Company is one of the world’s leading entertainment services with approximately 231 million paid memberships in over 190 countries enjoying TV series, films and games across a wide variety of genres and languages. Members can play, pause and resume to watch, as much as they want, anytime, anywhere, and can change their plans at any time.\n\nBasis of Presentation\n\nThe consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. Intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated.\n\nUse of Estimates\n\nThe preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Significant items subject to such estimates and assumptions include the content asset amortization policy and the recognition and measurement of income tax assets and liabilities. The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that the Company believes to be reasonable under the circumstances. On an ongoing basis, the Company evaluates these assumptions, judgments and estimates. Actual results may differ from these estimates.\n\nRecently adopted accounting pronouncements\n\nIn October 2021, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2021-08, Business Combinations (Topic 805): Accounting for Contract Assets and Contract Liabilities from Contracts with Customers, which requires an acquirer in a business combination to recognize and measure contract assets and contract liabilities in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers. The Company adopted ASU 2021-08 in the first quarter of 2022 and the adoption had no material impact to the Company’s consolidated financial statements.\n\nIn November 2021, the FASB issued ASU 2021-10, Government Assistance (Topic 832): Disclosures by Business Entities about Government Assistance, requiring annual disclosures about transactions with a government that are accounted for by analogizing to a grant or contribution accounting model. The new guidance requires the disclosure of the nature of the transactions, the accounting for the transactions, and the effect of the transactions on the financial statements. The Company adopted ASU 2021-10 during the year ended December\xa031, 2022, which most significantly impacts disclosures of tax incentives related to the production of content.\n\nCash Equivalents and Short-term Investments\n\nThe Company considers investments in instruments purchased with an original maturity of 90 days or less to be cash equivalents. The Company also classifies amounts in transit from payment processors for customer credit card and debit card transactions as cash equivalents.\n\nThe Company classifies short-term investments, which consist of marketable securities with original maturities in excess of 90 days as available-for-sale. Short-term investments are reported at fair value, with allowances for credit losses included in “Interest and other income (expense)” in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and unrealized gains and losses included in “Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)” within Stockholders’ equity in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Company uses the specific identification method to determine cost in calculating realized gains and losses upon the sale of short-term investments.\n\nShort-term investments are reviewed periodically for allowances for credit losses and impairment. When evaluating the investments, the Company reviews factors such as the extent to which the fair value of the security is less than the amortized cost basis, adverse conditions specifically related to the security, the financial condition of the issuer, the Company’s intent to sell, and whether it would be more likely than not that the Company would be required to sell the investments before the recovery of their amortized cost basis.\n\n43', 'Table of Contents\n\nContent\n\nThe Company acquires, licenses and produces content, including original programming, in order to offer members unlimited viewing of video entertainment. The content licenses are for a fixed fee and specific windows of availability. Payment terms for certain content licenses and the production of content require more upfront cash payments relative to the amortization expense. Payments for content, including additions to content assets and the changes in related liabilities, are classified within "Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities" on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.\n\nThe Company recognizes content assets (licensed and produced) as “Content assets, net” on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. For licensed content, the Company capitalizes the fee per title and records a corresponding liability at the gross amount of the liability when the license period begins, the cost of the title is known and the title is accepted and available for streaming. For produced content, the Company capitalizes costs associated with the production, including development costs, direct costs and production overhead. Participations and residuals are expensed in line with the amortization of production costs.\n\nBased on factors including historical and estimated viewing patterns, the Company amortizes the content assets (licensed and produced) in “Cost of revenues” on the Consolidated Statements of Operations over the shorter of each title\'s contractual window of availability or estimated period of use or ten years, beginning with the month of first availability. The amortization is on an accelerated basis, as the Company typically expects more upfront viewing, and film amortization is more accelerated than TV series amortization. On average, over 90% of a licensed or produced content asset is expected to be amortized within four years after its month of first availability. The Company reviews factors impacting the amortization of the content assets on a regular basis. The Company\'s estimates related to these factors require considerable management judgment.\n\nIn the normal course of business, the Company, or a third-party producing content on the Company\'s behalf, may qualify for tax incentives through eligible spend on productions. The accounting for tax incentives is dependent on the particular type of incentive, including the nature of the benefit and the location the incentive is earned. In general, tax incentives are realized as cash receipts and may be received prior to or after a title launches on the Company’s service. Upon a title’s launch, any amounts the Company is eligible for through qualified production spend but has not received, are recognized in “Other current assets” or “Other non-current assets” on the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets as receivables. Tax incentives are generally accounted for as a reduction to the cost basis of the Company’s content assets (presented in “Content assets, net”) and reduces content amortization over the life of the title (as presented in “Cost of revenues”) on the Consolidated Statement of Operations.\n\nThe Company\'s business model is subscription based as opposed to a model generating revenues at a specific title level. Content assets (licensed and produced) are predominantly monetized as a group and therefore are reviewed in aggregate at a group level when an event or change in circumstances indicates a change in the expected usefulness of the content or that the fair value may be less than unamortized cost. To date, the Company has not identified any such event or changes in circumstances. If such changes are identified in the future, these aggregated content assets will be stated at the lower of unamortized cost or fair value. In addition, unamortized costs for assets that have been, or are expected to be, abandoned are written off.\n\nAcquisitions\n\nThe Company uses its best estimates and assumptions to assign fair value to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date. In addition, uncertain tax positions, tax-related valuation allowances and pre-acquisition contingencies are initially recorded in connection with a business combination as of the acquisition date.\n\nProperty and Equipment\n\nProperty and equipment are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method over the shorter of the estimated useful lives of the respective assets, generally up to 30 years, or the expected lease term for leasehold improvements, if applicable.\n\nTrade Receivables\n\nTrade receivables consist primarily of amounts related to members and payment partners that collect membership fees on the Company\'s behalf. The Company evaluates the need for an allowance for credit losses based on historical collection trends, the financial condition of its payment partners, and external market factors. The Company\'s allowance for credit losses was not material as of December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021.\n\nMarketing\n\nMarketing expenses consist primarily of advertising expenses and certain payments made to the Company’s partners, including consumer electronics ("CE") manufacturers, multichannel video programming distributors ("MVPDs"), mobile\n\n44', 'Table of Contents\n\noperators and internet service providers ("ISPs"). Advertising expenses include promotional activities such as digital and television advertising. Advertising costs are expensed as incurred. Advertising expenses were $1,586 million, $1,669 million and $1,447 million for the years ended December\xa031, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Marketing expenses also include payroll and related expenses for personnel that support the Company\'s marketing activities.\n\nIncome Taxes\n\nThe Company records a provision for income taxes for the anticipated tax consequences of the reported results of operations using the asset and liability method. Deferred income taxes are recognized by applying enacted statutory tax rates applicable to future years to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases as well as net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. The measurement of deferred tax assets is reduced, if necessary, by a valuation allowance for any tax benefits for which future realization is uncertain.\n\nThe Company did not recognize certain tax benefits from uncertain tax positions within the provision for income taxes. The Company may recognize a tax benefit only if it is more likely than not the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such positions are then measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon settlement. The Company recognizes interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions in income tax expense. See Note 10 Income Taxes to the consolidated financial statements for further information regarding income taxes.\n\nForeign Currency\n\nThe functional currency for the Company\'s subsidiaries is determined based on the primary economic environment in which the subsidiary operates. The Company translates the assets and liabilities of its non-U.S. dollar functional currency subsidiaries into U.S. dollars using exchange rates in effect at the end of each period. Revenues and expenses for these subsidiaries are translated using rates that approximate those in effect during the period. Gains and losses from these translations are recognized in cumulative translation adjustment included in "Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)" in Stockholders’ equity on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\n\nThe Company remeasures monetary assets and liabilities that are not denominated in the functional currency at exchange rates in effect at the end of each period. Gains and losses from these remeasurements are recognized in interest and other income (expense). Foreign currency transactions resulted in a gain of $282 million and $403\xa0million for the years ended December\xa031, 2022 and 2021, respectively, and a loss of $660\xa0million for the year ended December\xa031, 2020. These gains and losses were primarily due to the non-cash remeasurement of our Senior Notes denominated in euros and the remeasurement of cash and content liability positions denominated in currencies other than functional currencies.\n\nStock-Based Compensation\n\nThe Company grants non-qualified stock options to its employees on a monthly basis. Stock-based compensation expense is based on the fair value of the options at the grant date and is recognized, net of forfeitures, over the requisite service period. See Note 9 Stockholders\' Equity to the consolidated financial statements for further information regarding stock-based compensation.\n\n2.Revenue Recognition\n\nThe Company\'s primary source of revenues is from monthly membership fees. Members are billed in advance of the start of their monthly membership and revenues are recognized ratably over each monthly membership period. Revenues are presented net of the taxes that are collected from members and remitted to governmental authorities. The Company is the principal in all its relationships where partners, including CE manufacturers, MVPDs, mobile operators and ISPs, provide access to the service as the Company retains control over service delivery to its members. Typically, payments made to the partners, such as for marketing, are expensed. However, if there is no distinct service provided in exchange for the payments made to the partners or if the price that the member pays is established by the partners and there is no standalone price for the Netflix service (for instance, in a bundle), these payments are recognized as a reduction of revenues.\n\nThe following tables summarize revenues, paid net membership additions, and ending paid memberships by region for the years ended December\xa031, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively:\n\nUnited States and Canada (UCAN)\n\n45', 'Table of Contents\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|  | | |  | | | As of/ Year Ended December 31, | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |\n|  | | |  | | | 2022 | | |  | | | 2021 | | |  | | | 2020 | | |\n|  | | |  | | | (in thousands) | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |\n| Revenues | | |  | | | $ | 14,084,643 |  |  | | | $ | 12,972,100 |  |  | | | $ | 11,455,396 |  |\n| Paid net membership additions (losses) | | |  | | | (919) | |  |  | | | 1,279 | |  |  | | | 6,274 | |  |\n| Paid memberships at end of period | | |  | | | 74,296 | |  |  | | | 75,215 | |  |  | | | 73,936 | |  |\n|  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |\n|  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |\n\nEurope, Middle East, and Africa (EMEA)\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|  | | |  | | | As of/ Year Ended December 31, | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |\n|  | | |  | | | 2022 | | |  | | | 2021 | | |  | | | 2020 | | |\n|  | | |  | | | (in thousands) | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |\n| Revenues | | |  | | | $ | 9,745,015 |  |  | | | $ | 9,699,819 |  |  | | | $ | 7,772,252 |  |\n| Paid net membership additions | | |  | | | 2,693 | |  |  | | | 7,338 | |  |  | | | 14,920 | |  |\n| Paid memberships at end of period | | |  | | | 76,729 | |  |  | | | 74,036 | |  |  | | | 66,698 | |  |\n|  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |\n|  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |\n\nLatin America (LATAM)\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|  | | |  | | | As of/ Year Ended December 31, | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |\n|  | | |  | | | 2022 | | |  | | | 2021 | | |  | | | 2020 | | |\n|  | | |  | | | (in thousands) | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |\n| Revenues | | |  | | | $ | 4,069,973 |  |  | | | $ | 3,576,976 |  |  | | | $ | 3,156,727 |  |\n| Paid net membership additions | | |  | | | 1,738 | |  |  | | | 2,424 | |  |  | | | 6,120 | |  |\n| Paid memberships at end of period | | |  | | | 41,699 | |  |  | | | 39,961 | |  |  | | | 37,537 | |  |\n|  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |\n|  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |\n\nAsia-Pacific (APAC)\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|  | | |  | | | As of/ Year Ended December 31, | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |\n|  | | |  | | | 2022 | | |  | | | 2021 | | |  | | | 2020 | | |\n|  | | |  | | | (in thousands) | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |\n| Revenues | | |  | | | $ | 3,570,221 |  |  | | | $ | 3,266,601 |  |  | | | $ | 2,372,300 |  |\n| Paid net membership additions | | |  | | | 5,391 | |  |  | | | 7,140 | |  |  | | | 9,259 | |  |\n| Paid memberships at end of period | | |  | | | 38,023 | |  |  | | | 32,632 | |  |  | | | 25,492 | |  |\n|  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |\n|  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |\n\n|  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|  |  |  |\n| A paid membership (also referred to as a paid subscription) is defined as a membership that has the right to receive Netflix service following sign-up and a method of payment being provided, and that is not part of a free trial or certain other promotions that may be offered by the Company to new or rejoining members. Certain members have the option to add extra member sub accounts. These extra member sub accounts are not included in paid memberships. A membership is canceled and ceases to be reflected in the above metrics as of the effective cancellation date. Voluntary cancellations generally become effective at the end of the prepaid membership period. Involuntary cancellations, as a result of a failed method of payment, become effective immediately. Memberships are assigned to territories based on the geographic location used at time of sign-up as determined by the Company’s internal systems, which utilize industry standard geo-location technology. | | |\n\nTotal U.S. revenues, inclusive of DVD revenues not reported in the tables above, were $13.0\xa0billion, $12.1\xa0billion and $10.8\xa0billion for the years ended December\xa031, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. DVD revenues were $0.1\xa0billion, $0.2\xa0billion, and $0.2\xa0billion for the years ended December\xa031, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\n\nDeferred revenue consists of membership fees billed that have not been recognized, as well as gift and other prepaid memberships that have not been fully redeemed. As of December 31, 2022, total deferred revenue was $1,265\xa0million, the vast\n\n46', 'Table of Contents\n\nmajority of which was related to membership fees billed that are expected to be recognized as revenue within the next month. The remaining deferred revenue balance, which is related to gift cards and other prepaid memberships, will be recognized as revenue over the period of service after redemption, which is expected to occur over the next 12 months. The $56 million increase in deferred revenue as compared to the balance of $1,209\xa0million for the year ended December\xa031, 2021, is a result of the increase in membership fees billed due to increased memberships and acquisition-related deferred revenue.\n\n3.Earnings per Share\n\nBasic earnings per share is computed using the weighted-average number of outstanding shares of common stock during the period. Diluted earnings per share is computed using the weighted-average number of outstanding shares of common stock and, when dilutive, potential common shares outstanding during the period.

These leases generally have terms which range from 1 year to 15 years, and often include one or more options to renew. These renewal terms can extend the lease term from 1 year to 20 years, and are included in the lease term when it is reasonably certain that the Company will exercise the option. These operating leases are included in "Other non-current assets" on the Company\'s Consolidated Balance Sheets, and represent the Company’s right to use the underlying asset for the lease term. The Company’s obligations to make lease payments are included in "Accrued expenses and other liabilities" and "Other non-current liabilities" on the Company\'s Consolidated Balance Sheets. \xa0Operating lease right-of-use assets and liabilities are recognized at the commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. The Company has entered into various short-term operating leases with an initial term of twelve months or less. These leases are not recorded on the Company\'s Consolidated Balance Sheets. All operating lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Because the rate implicit in each lease is not readily determinable, the Company uses its incremental borrowing rate to determine the present value of the lease payments. The Company has certain contracts for real estate which may contain lease and non-lease components which it has elected to treat as a single lease component.\n\nThe components of lease costs for the years ended December\xa031, 2022, 2021 and 2020 were as follows:\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|  | | | Year ended December 31, | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |\n|  | | | 2022 | | |  | | | 2021 | | |  | | | 2020 | | |\n|  | | | (in thousands) | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |\n| Operating lease cost | | | $ | 413,664 |  |  | | | $ | 389,805 |  |  | | | $ | 323,905 |  |\n| Short-term lease cost | | | 194,764 | |  |  | | | 152,765 | |  |  | | | 116,606 | |  |\n| Total lease cost | | | $ | 608,428 |  |  | | | $ | 542,570 |  |  | | | $ | 440,511 |  |\n\nInformation related to the Company\'s operating right-of-use assets and related operating lease liabilities were as follows:\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|  | | | Year ended December 31, | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |\n|  | | | 2022 | | |  | | | 2021 | | |  | | | 2020 | | |\n|  | | | (in thousands) | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |\n| Cash paid for operating lease liabilities | | | $ | 413,034 |  |  | | | $ | 349,586 |  |  | | | $ | 259,559 |  |\n| Right-of-use assets obtained in exchange for new operating lease obligations | | | 252,393 | |  |  | | | 764,142 | |  |  | | | 729,942 | |  |\n\n50', "Table of Contents\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|  | | | As of December 31, | | | | | | | | |\n|  | | | 2022 | | |  | | | 2021 | | |\n|  | | | (in thousands, except lease term and discount rate) | | | | | | | | |\n| Operating lease right-of-use assets, net | | | $ | 2,227,122 |  |  | | | $ | 2,446,573 |  |\n|  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |\n| Current operating lease liabilities | | | $ | 355,985 |  |  | | | $ | 315,189 |  |\n| Non-current operating lease liabilities | | | 2,222,503 | |  |  | | | 2,408,486 | |  |\n| Total operating lease liabilities | | | $ | 2,578,488 |  |  | | | $ | 2,723,675 |  |\n|  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |\n| Weighted-average remaining lease term | | | 8.3 years | | |  | | | 9.2 years | | |\n| Weighted-average discount rate | | | 3.2 | | % |  | | | 3.1 | | % |\n\nMaturities of operating lease liabilities as of December\xa031, 2022 were as follows (in thousands):\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| Due in 12 month period ended December 31, | | | | | |\n| 2023 | | | $ | 433,167 |  |\n| 2024 | | | 406,293 | |  |\n| 2025 | | | 377,371 | |  |\n| 2026 | | | 368,496 | |  |\n| 2027 | | | 310,903 | |  |\n| Thereafter | | | 1,036,327 | |  |\n|  | | | 2,932,557 | |  |\n| Less imputed interest | | | (354,069) | |  |\n| Total operating lease liabilities | | | 2,578,488 | |  |\n\nThe Company has additional operating leases for real estate of $419 million which have not commenced as of December\xa031, 2022, and as such, have not been recognized on the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets.

A portion of the outstanding Notes is denominated in foreign currency (comprised of €5,170 million) and is remeasured into U.S. dollars at each balance sheet date (with remeasurement gain totaling $353 million for the year ended December\xa031, 2022).\n\nThe following table provides a summary of the Company\'s outstanding debt and the fair values based on quoted market prices in less active markets as of December\xa031, 2022 and December\xa031, 2021:\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|  | | | Principal Amount at Par | | | | | | | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | | Level 2 Fair Value as of | | | | | | | | |\n|  | | | December 31, 2022 | | |  | | | December 31, 2021 | | |  | | | Issuance Date | | |  | | | Maturity | | |  | | | December 31, 2022 | | |  | | | December 31, 2021 | | |\n|  | | | (in millions) | | | | | | | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | | (in millions) | | | | | | | | |\n| 5.500% Senior Notes | | | $ | — |  |  | | | $ | 700 |  |  | | | February 2015 | | |  | | | February 2022 | | |  | | | $ | — |  |  | | | $ | 704 |  |\n| 5.750% Senior Notes | | | 400 | |  |  | | | 400 | |  |  | | | February 2014 | | |  | | | March 2024 | | |  | | | 404 | |  |  | | | 437 | |  |\n| 5.875% Senior Notes | | | 800 | |  |  | | | 800 | |  |  | | | February 2015 | | |  | | | February 2025 | | |  | | | 811 | |  |  | | | 899 | |  |\n| 3.000% Senior Notes (1) | | | 503 | |  |  | | | 535 | |  |  | | | April 2020 | | |  | | | June 2025 | | |  | | | 495 | |  |  | | | 581 | |  |\n| 3.625% Senior Notes | | | 500 | |  |  | | | 500 | |  |  | | | April 2020 | | |  | | | June 2025 | | |  | | | 479 | |  |  | | | 529 | |  |\n| 4.375% Senior Notes | | | 1,000 | |  |  | | | 1,000 | |  |  | | | October 2016 | | |  | | | November 2026 | | |  | | | 980 | |  |  | | | 1,111 | |  |\n| 3.625% Senior Notes (1) | | | 1,391 | |  |  | | | 1,480 | |  |  | | | May 2017 | | |  | | | May 2027 | | |  | | | 1,338 | |  |  | | | 1,702 | |  |\n| 4.875% Senior Notes | | | 1,600 | |  |  | | | 1,600 | |  |  | | | October 2017 | | |  | | | April 2028 | | |  | | | 1,557 | |  |  | | | 1,829 | |  |\n| 5.875% Senior Notes | | | 1,900 | |  |  | | | 1,900 | |  |  | | | April 2018 | | |  | | | November 2028 | | |  | | | 1,930 | |  |  | | | 2,293 | |  |\n| 4.625% Senior Notes (1) | | | 1,177 | |  |  | | | 1,252 | |  |  | | | October 2018 | | |  | | | May 2029 | | |  | | | 1,151 | |  |  | | | 1,565 | |  |\n| 6.375% Senior Notes | | | 800 | |  |  | | | 800 | |  |  | | | October 2018 | | |  | | | May 2029 | | |  | | | 830 | |  |  | | | 999 | |  |\n| 3.875% Senior Notes (1) | | | 1,284 | |  |  | | | 1,366 | |  |  | | | April 2019 | | |  | | | November 2029 | | |  | | | 1,201 | |  |  | | | 1,651 | |  |\n| 5.375% Senior Notes | | | 900 | |  |  | | | 900 | |  |  | | | April 2019 | | |  | | | November 2029 | | |  | | | 885 | |  |  | | | 1,068 | |  |\n| 3.625% Senior Notes (1) | | | 1,177 | |  |  | | | 1,252 | |  |  | | | October 2019 | | |  | | | June 2030 | | |  | | | 1,078 | |  |  | | | 1,493 | |  |\n| 4.875% Senior Notes | | | 1,000 | |  |  | | | 1,000 | |  |  | | | October 2019 | | |  | | | June 2030 | | |  | | | 944 | |  |  | | | 1,169 | |  |\n|  | | | $ | 14,432 |  |  | | | $ | 15,485 |  |  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | | $ | 14,083 |  |  | | | $ | 18,030 |  |\n|  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |\n|  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |\n|  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |\n\n(1) The following Senior Notes have a principal amount denominated in euro: 3.000% Senior Notes for €470\xa0million, 3.625% Senior Notes for €1,300\xa0million, 4.625% Senior Notes for €1,100\xa0million, 3.875% Senior Notes for €1,200\xa0million, and 3.625% Senior Notes for €1,100\xa0million.\n\nEach of the Notes are repayable in whole or in part upon the occurrence of a change of control, at the option of the holders, at a purchase price in cash equal to 101% of the principal plus accrued interest. The Company may redeem the Notes prior to maturity in whole or in part at an amount equal to the principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest and an applicable premium. The Notes include, among other terms and conditions, limitations on the Company\'s ability to create, incur or allow certain liens; enter into sale and lease-back transactions; create, assume, incur or guarantee additional indebtedness of certain of the Company\'s subsidiaries; and consolidate or merge with, or convey, transfer or lease all or substantially all of the Company\'s and its subsidiaries assets, to another person. As of December\xa031, 2022 and December\xa031, 2021, the Company was in compliance with all related covenants.\n\nRevolving Credit\xa0Facility\n\nAs of December 31, 2022, the Company has a $1\xa0billion unsecured revolving credit facility ("Revolving Credit Agreement"), which matures on June 17, 2026. Revolving loans may be borrowed, repaid and reborrowed until June 17, 2026, at which time all amounts borrowed must be repaid. The Company may use the proceeds of future borrowings under the Revolving Credit Agreement for working capital and general corporate purposes. As of\xa0December\xa031, 2022, no amounts have been borrowed under the Revolving Credit Agreement.\n\n52', 'Table of Contents\n\nThe borrowings under the Revolving Credit Agreement bear interest, at the Company’s option, of either (i) a floating rate equal to a base rate (the “Alternate Base Rate”) or (ii) a rate equal to an adjusted London interbank offered rate (the “Adjusted LIBO Rate”), plus a margin of\xa00.75%. The Alternate Base Rate is defined as the greatest of (A) the rate of interest published by the Wall Street Journal, from time to time, as the prime rate, (B) the federal funds rate, plus\xa00.500%\xa0and (C) the Adjusted LIBO Rate for a one-month interest period, plus\xa01.00%. The Adjusted LIBO Rate is defined as the London interbank offered rate for deposits in U.S. dollars, for the relevant interest period, adjusted for statutory reserve requirements, but in no event shall the Adjusted LIBO Rate be less than\xa00.00%\xa0per annum. Regulatory authorities that oversee financial markets have announced that after the end of 2021, they would no longer compel banks currently reporting information used to set the Adjusted LIBO Rate to continue to make rate submissions, and that publication of the Adjusted LIBO Rate based upon U.S. Dollars is expected to cease on June 30, 2023. The Revolving Credit Agreement contains customary provisions for the replacement of the Adjusted LIBO Rate with an alternate benchmark rate, including a rate based on the secured overnight financing rate published by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, as the Adjusted LIBO Rate is phased out in the lending market. The Company does not anticipate that the replacement of the Adjusted LIBO Rate with such alternative benchmark rate, as provided in the Revolving Credit Agreement, will materially impact its liquidity or financial position.\n\nThe Company is also obligated to pay a commitment fee on the undrawn amounts of the Revolving Credit Agreement at an annual rate of\xa00.10%. The Revolving Credit Agreement requires the Company to comply with certain covenants, including covenants that limit or restrict the ability of the Company’s subsidiaries to incur debt and limit or restrict the ability of the Company and its subsidiaries to grant liens and enter into sale and leaseback transactions; and, in the case of the Company or a guarantor, merge, consolidate, liquidate, dissolve or sell, transfer, lease or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole. As of\xa0December\xa031, 2022 and December\xa031, 2021, the Company was in compliance with all related covenants.\n\n7.Commitments and Contingencies\n\nContent\n\nAt December\xa031, 2022, the Company had $21.8 billion of obligations comprised of $4.5 billion included in "Current content liabilities" and $3.1 billion of "Non-current content liabilities" on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and $14.2 billion of obligations that are not reflected on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as they did not yet meet the criteria for asset recognition.\n\nAt December\xa031, 2021, the Company had $23.2 billion of obligations comprised of $4.3 billion included in "Current content liabilities" and $3.1 billion of "Non-current content liabilities" on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and $15.8 billion of obligations that are not reflected on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as they did not yet meet the criteria for asset recognition.\n\nThe expected timing of payments for these content obligations is as follows:\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|  | | | As of December 31, | | | | | | | | |\n|  | | | 2022 | | |  | | | 2021 | | |\n|  | | | (in\xa0thousands) | | | | | | | | |\n| Less than one year | | | $ | 10,038,483 |  |  | | | $ | 10,019,306 |  |\n| Due after one year and through 3 years | | | 9,425,551 | |  |  | | | 9,238,315 | |  |\n| Due after 3 years and through 5 years | | | 2,124,307 | |  |  | | | 3,238,977 | |  |\n| Due after 5 years | | | 243,606 | |  |  | | | 664,762 | |  |\n| Total content obligations | | | $ | 21,831,947 |  |  | | | $ | 23,161,360 |  |\n\nContent obligations include amounts related to the acquisition, licensing and production of content. Obligations that are in non-U.S. dollar currencies are translated to the U.S. dollar at period end rates. An obligation for the production of content includes non-cancelable commitments under creative talent and employment agreements as well as other production related commitments. An obligation for the acquisition and licensing of content is incurred at the time the Company enters into an agreement to obtain future titles. Once a title becomes available, a content liability is recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Certain agreements include the obligation to license rights for unknown future titles, the ultimate quantity and/or fees for which are not yet determinable as of the reporting date. Traditional film output deals, or certain TV series license agreements where the number of seasons to be aired is unknown, are examples of such license agreements. The Company does not include any estimated obligation for these future titles beyond the known minimum amount. However, the unknown obligations are expected to be significant.\n\nLegal Proceedings\n\n53', "Table of Contents\n\nFrom time to time, in the normal course of its operations, the Company is subject to litigation matters and claims, including claims relating to employee relations, business practices and patent infringement. Litigation can be expensive and disruptive to normal business operations. Moreover, the results of complex legal proceedings are difficult to predict and the Company's view of these matters may change in the future as the litigation and events related thereto unfold. The Company expenses legal fees as incurred. The Company records a provision for contingent losses when it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. An unfavorable outcome to any legal matter, if material, could have an adverse effect on the Company's operations or its financial position, liquidity or results of operations.\n\nThe Company is involved in litigation matters not listed herein but does not consider the matters to be material either individually or in the aggregate at this time. The Company's view of the matters not listed may change in the future as the litigation and events related thereto unfold.\n\n8.Guarantees—Indemnification Obligations\n\nIn the ordinary course of business, the Company has entered into contractual arrangements under which it has agreed to provide indemnification of varying scope and terms to business partners and other parties with respect to certain matters, including, but not limited to, losses arising out of the Company’s breach of such agreements and out of intellectual property infringement claims made by third parties. In these circumstances, payment may be conditional on the other party making a claim pursuant to the procedures specified in the particular contract.\n\nThe Company’s obligations under these agreements may be limited in terms of time or amount, and in some instances, the Company may have recourse against third parties for certain payments. In addition, the Company has entered into indemnification agreements with its directors and certain of its officers that will require it, among other things, to indemnify them against certain liabilities that may arise by reason of their status or service as directors or officers. The terms of such obligations vary.\n\nIt is not possible to make a reasonable estimate of the maximum potential amount of future payments under these or similar agreements due to the conditional nature of the Company’s obligations and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular agreement. No amount has been accrued in the accompanying consolidated financial statements with respect to these indemnification guarantees.\n\n54", "Table of Contents\n\n9.Stockholders’ Equity\n\nVoting Rights\n\nThe holders of each share of common stock shall be entitled to one vote per share on all matters to be voted upon by the Company’s stockholders.\n\nStock Option Plan\n\nOn June 4, 2020, the Company's stockholders approved the 2020 Stock Plan, which was adopted by the Company's Board of Directors on March 4, 2020 subject to stockholder approval. The 2020 Stock Plan is the successor to the 2011 Stock Plan. The 2020 Stock Plan provides for the grant of incentive stock options to employees and for the grant of non-statutory stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock and restricted stock units to employees, directors and consultants. The 2020 Stock Plan authorized 17,500,000 new shares to be available for award grants. As of the date the 2020 Stock Plan was adopted by the Company's Board of Directors, 5,530,106 shares were available to be granted under the 2011 Stock Plan. These shares are available for award grants under the 2020 Stock Plan.\n\nA summary of the activities related to the Company’s stock option plans is as follows:\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|  | | | Shares\xa0Available for Grant | | |  | | | Options Outstanding | | | | | | | | |\n|  | | | Number of Shares | | |  | | | Weighted- Average Exercise Price  (per Share) | | |\n| Balances as of December 31, 2019 | | | 6,111,561 | |  |  | | | 20,859,326 | |  |  | | | $ | 124.28 |  |\n| New Shares Authorized | | | 17,500,000 | |  |  | | | — | |  |  | | | — | |  |\n| Granted | | | (1,909,476) | |  |  | | | 1,909,476 | |  |  | | | 432.34 | |  |\n| Exercised | | |  | | |  | | | (4,088,612) | |  |  | | | 58.35 | |  |\n| Expired | | | — | |  |  | | | (3,380) | |  |  | | | 27.54 | |  |\n| Balances as of December 31, 2020 | | | 21,702,085 | |  |  | | | 18,676,810 | |  |  | | | $ | 170.23 |  |\n| Granted | | | (1,556,725) | |  |  | | | 1,556,725 | |  |  | | | 554.11 | |  |\n| Exercised | | |  | | |  | | | (2,632,324) | |  |  | | | 65.97 | |  |\n| Expired | | | — | |  |  | | | (5,360) | |  |  | | | 34.63 | |  |\n| Balances as of December 31, 2021 | | | 20,145,360 | |  |  | | | 17,595,851 | |  |  | | | $ | 219.83 |  |\n| Granted | | | (3,691,257) | |  |  | | | 3,691,257 | |  |  | | | 267.94 | |  |\n| Exercised | | | — | |  |  | | | (1,383,669) | |  |  | | | 27.19 | |  |\n| Expired | | | — | |  |  | | | (6,578) | |  |  | | | 11.10 | |  |\n| Balances as of December 31, 2022 | | | 16,454,103 | |  |  | | | 19,896,861 | |  |  | | | $ | 242.22 |  |\n| Vested and exercisable at December\xa031, 2022 | | |  | | |  | | | 19,896,861 | |  |  | | | $ | 242.22 |  |\n\nThe aggregate intrinsic value of the Company's outstanding stock options as of December\xa031, 2022 was $1,951\xa0million and represents the total pretax intrinsic value (the difference between the Company’s closing stock price on the last trading day of 2022 and the exercise price, multiplied by the number of in-the-money options) that would have been received by the option holders had all option holders exercised their options on the last trading day of 2022. This amount changes based on the fair market value of the Company’s common stock. Total intrinsic value of options exercised for the years ended December\xa031, 2022, 2021 and 2020 was $346 million, $1,363 million and $1,596 million, respectively. The weighted-average remaining contractual term of the Company's outstanding stock options as of December\xa031, 2022 included in the table above was 5.61 years.\n\nCash received from option exercises for the years ended December\xa031, 2022, 2021 and 2020 was $36 million, $174 million and $235 million, respectively. The Company records stock option exercises based on trade date.\n\n55", 'Table of Contents\n\nStock-Based Compensation\n\nStock options granted are exercisable for the full ten year contractual term regardless of employment status. The following table summarizes the assumptions used to value option grants using the lattice-binomial model and the valuation data:\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|  | | |  | | | Year\xa0Ended\xa0December\xa031, | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |\n|  | | |  | | | 2022 | | |  | | | 2021 | | |  | | | 2020 | | |\n| Dividend yield | | |  | | | — | | % |  | | | — | | % |  | | | — | | % |\n| Expected volatility | | |  | | | 38% - 52% | | |  | | | 34% - 41% | | |  | | | 37% - 45% | | |\n| Risk-free interest rate | | |  | | | 1.71% - 3.79% | | |  | | | 1.08% - 1.62% | | |  | | | 0.67% - 1.71% | | |\n| Suboptimal exercise factor | | |  | | | 4.71 - 4.82 | | |  | | | 3.81 - 3.98 | | |  | | | 3.34 - 3.67 | | |\n| Valuation data: | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |\n| Weighted-average fair value (per share) | | |  | | | $ | 155.88 |  |  | | | $ | 259.01 |  |  | | | $ | 217.42 |  |\n| Total stock-based compensation expense (in thousands) | | |  | | | 575,452 | |  |  | | | 403,220 | |  |  | | | 415,180 | |  |\n| Total income tax impact on provision (in thousands) | | |  | | | 127,289 | |  |  | | | 89,642 | |  |  | | | 91,718 | |  |\n\nThe Company considers several factors in determining the suboptimal exercise factor, including the historical and estimated option exercise behavior.\n\nThe Company calculates expected volatility based solely on implied volatility. The Company believes that implied volatility of publicly traded options in its common stock is more reflective of market conditions, and given consistently high trade volumes of the options, can reasonably be expected to be a better indicator of expected volatility than historical volatility of its common stock.\n\nIn valuing shares issued under the Company’s employee stock option plans, the Company bases the risk-free interest rate on U.S. Treasury zero-coupon issues with terms similar to the contractual term of the options. The Company does not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future and therefore uses an expected dividend yield of\xa0zero\xa0in the option valuation model. The Company does not use a post-vesting termination rate as options are fully vested upon grant date.\n\nStock Repurchases\n\nIn March 2021, the Company’s Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $5\xa0billion of its common stock, with no expiration date. Stock repurchases may be effected through open market repurchases in compliance with Rule 10b-18 under the Exchange Act, including through the use of trading plans intended to qualify under Rule 10b5-1 under the Exchange Act, privately-negotiated transactions, accelerated stock repurchase plans, block purchases, or other similar purchase techniques and in such amounts as management deems appropriate. The Company is not obligated to repurchase any specific number of shares, and the timing and actual number of shares repurchased will depend on a variety of factors, including the Company’s stock price, general economic, business and market conditions, and alternative investment opportunities. The Company may discontinue any repurchases of its common stock at any time without prior notice. There were no repurchases during the year ended December\xa031, 2022. As of December\xa031, 2022, $4.4\xa0billion remain available for repurchases. Shares repurchased by the Company are accounted for when the transaction is settled. Direct costs incurred to acquire the shares are included in the total cost of the shares.\n\n10.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Income Taxes\n\nIncome before provision for income taxes was as follows:\n\n|  |  |  |

assets are classified as “Other non-current assets” on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December\xa031, 2022 and December\xa031, 2021. In evaluating its ability to realize the net deferred tax assets, the Company considered all available positive and negative evidence, including its past operating results and the forecast of future market growth, forecasted earnings, future taxable income, and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies. As of December\xa031, 2022, the valuation allowance of $343 million was related to the California R&D credits and certain foreign tax attributes that the Company does not expect to realize.\n\nAs of December\xa031, 2022, the Company\'s California R&D tax credit carryforwards for tax return purposes was $504 million.\n\nThe unrecognized tax benefits that are not expected to result in payment or receipt of cash within one year are classified as “Other non-current liabilities” and a reduction of deferred tax assets which is classified as "Other non-current assets" in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of December\xa031, 2022, the total amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits was $227 million, of which $155 million, if recognized, would favorably impact the Company’s effective tax rate. As of\xa0December\xa031, 2021, the total amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits was $203 million, of which\xa0$136 million, if recognized, would favorably impact the Company’s effective tax rate. The aggregate changes in the Company’s total gross amount of unrecognized tax benefits are summarized as follows (in thousands):\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| Balances as of December 31, 2020 | | | $ | 140,124 |  |\n| Increases related to tax positions taken during prior periods | | | 27,116 | |  |\n| Decreases related to tax positions taken during prior periods | | | — | |  |\n| Increases related to tax positions taken during the current period | | | 35,317 | |  |\n| Decreases related to expiration of statute of limitations | | | — | |  |\n| Balances as of December 31, 2021 | | | 202,557 | |  |\n| Increases related to tax positions taken during prior periods | | | — | |  |\n| Decreases related to tax positions taken during prior periods | | | (2,445) | |  |\n| Increases related to tax positions taken during the current period | | | 26,865 | |  |\n| Decreases related to expiration of statute of limitations | | | — | |  |\n|  | | |  | | |\n|  | | |  | | |\n| Balances as of December 31, 2022 | | | $ | 226,977 |  |\n\n58', 'Table of Contents\n\nThe Company includes interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits within the provision for income taxes and in “Other non-current liabilities” in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Interest and penalties included in the Company\'s provision for income taxes were not material in all the periods presented.\n\nThe Company files U.S. Federal, state and foreign tax returns. The Company is currently under examination by the IRS for years 2016 through 2018 and is subject to examination for 2019 through 2021. The foreign and state tax returns for years 2015 through 2021 are subject to examination by various states and foreign jurisdictions. While the Company is in various stages of inquiries and examinations for some state and federal taxing authorities, we believe that our tax positions will more likely than not be sustained. Nonetheless, it is possible that future obligations related to these matters could arise.\n\nGiven the potential outcome of the current examinations as well as the impact of the current examinations on the potential expiration of the statute of limitations, it is reasonably possible that the balance of unrecognized tax benefits could significantly change within the next twelve months. However, an estimate of the range of reasonably possible adjustments cannot be made at this time.\n\n11.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Employee Benefit Plan\n\nThe Company maintains a 401(k) savings plan covering substantially all of its employees. Eligible employees may contribute up to 80% of their annual salary through payroll deductions, but not more than the statutory limits set by the Internal Revenue Service. The Company matches employee contributions at the discretion of the Board. During 2022, 2021 and 2020, the Company’s matching contributions totaled $102 million, $85 million and $69 million, respectively.\n\nMultiemployer Benefit Plans\n\nThe Company contributes to various multiemployer defined pension plans under the terms of collective bargaining agreements that cover our union-represented employees. The risks of participating in multiemployer pension plans are different from single-employer plans such that (i) contributions made by the Company to the multiemployer pension plans may be used to provide benefits to employees of other participating employers; (ii) if the Company chooses to stop participating in the multiemployer pension plans, it may be required to pay those plans an amount based on the underfunded status of the plan; and (iii) if the Company stops contributing to the multiemployer pension plan, the unfunded obligations of the plan may become the obligation of the remaining participating employers. The Company also contributes to various other multiemployer benefit plans that provide health and welfare benefits to both active and retired participants. The Company does not participate in any multiemployer benefit plans that are individually significant to the Company.\n\nThe following table summarizes the Company\'s contributions to multiemployer pension and health plans for the years ended December\xa031, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively:\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|  | | | Year Ended December\xa031, | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |\n|  | | | 2022 | | |  | | | 2021 | | |  | | | 2020 | | |\n|  | | | (in thousands) | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |\n| Pension benefits | | | $ | 127,885 |  |  | | | $ | 111,133 |  |  | | | $ | 78,060 |  |\n| Health benefits | | | 96,285 | |  |  | | | 83,153 | |  |  | | | 52,322 | |  |\n| Total contributions | | | $ | 224,170 |  |  | | | $ | 194,286 |  |  | | | $ | 130,382 |  |\n\n12.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Segment and Geographic Information\n\nThe Company operates as one operating segment.

(“Netflix”, “the Company”, “registrant”, “we”, or “us”) is one of the world’s leading entertainment services with approximately 222 million paid memberships in over 190 countries enjoying TV series, documentaries, feature films and mobile games across a wide variety of genres and languages. Members can engage as much as they want, anytime, anywhere, on any internet-connected screen. Members can play, pause and resume watching, all without commercials. Additionally, we continue to offer our DVD-by-mail service in the United States (“U.S.”).\n\nWe are a pioneer in the delivery of streaming entertainment, launching our streaming service in 2007. Since this launch, we have developed an ecosystem for internet-connected screens and have added increasing amounts of content that enable consumers to enjoy entertainment directly on their internet-connected screens. As a result of these efforts, we have experienced growing consumer acceptance of, and interest in, the delivery of streaming entertainment.\n\nOur core strategy is to grow our streaming membership business globally within the parameters of our operating margin target. We are continuously improving our members\' experience by expanding our content with a focus on a programming mix of content that delights our members and attracts new members. For example, in 2021 we added mobile games to our service. In addition, we are continuously enhancing our user interface and extending our streaming service to more internet-connected screens. Our members can download a selection of titles for offline viewing.\n\nBUSINESS SEGMENTS\n\nWe operate as one operating segment. Our revenues are primarily derived from monthly membership fees for services related to streaming content to our members. See Note 12, Segment and Geographic Information, in the accompanying notes to our consolidated financial statements for further detail.\n\nCOMPETITION\n\nThe market for video entertainment is intensely competitive and subject to rapid change. We compete against other entertainment video providers, such as multichannel video programming distributors (“MVPDs”), streaming entertainment providers (including those that provide pirated content), video gaming providers and more broadly against other sources of entertainment that our members could choose in their moments of free time. We also compete against streaming entertainment providers and content producers in obtaining content for our service, both for licensed content and for original content projects.\n\nWhile consumers may maintain simultaneous relationships with multiple entertainment sources, we strive for consumers to choose us in their moments of free time. We have often referred to this choice as our objective of "winning moments of\n\n1', 'Table of Contents\n\ntruth." In attempting to win these moments of truth with our members, we are continually improving our service, including both our technology and our content, which is increasingly exclusive and curated, and includes our original programming.\n\nSEASONALITY\n\nOur membership growth exhibits a seasonal pattern that reflects variations when consumers buy internet-connected screens and when they tend to increase their viewing. Historically, the fourth quarter represents our greatest streaming membership growth. In addition, our membership growth can be impacted by our content release schedule and changes to pricing.\n\nINTELLECTUAL PROPERTY\n\nWe regard our trademarks, service marks, copyrights, patents, domain names, trade dress, trade secrets, proprietary technologies and similar intellectual property as important to our success. We use a combination of patent, trademark, copyright and trade secret laws and confidentiality agreements to protect our proprietary intellectual property. Our intellectual property rights extend to our technology, business processes and the content we produce and distribute through our service. We use the intellectual property of third parties in creating some of our content, merchandising our products and marketing our service. Our ability to provide our members with content they can watch depends on studios, content providers and other rights holders licensing rights, including distribution rights, to such content and certain related elements thereof, such as the public performance of music contained within the content we distribute. The license periods and the terms and conditions of such licenses vary. Our ability to protect and enforce our intellectual property rights is subject to certain risks and from time to time we encounter disputes over rights and obligations concerning intellectual property. We cannot provide assurance that we will prevail in any intellectual property disputes.\n\nREGULATION\n\nThe media landscape and the internet delivery of content have seen growing regulatory action. Historically, media has been highly regulated in many countries. We are seeing some of these legacy regulatory frameworks be updated and expanded to address services like ours. In particular, we are seeing some countries update their cultural support legislation to include services like Netflix. This includes content quotas, levies and investment obligations. Some even restrict the extent of ownership rights we can have both in our service and in our content. In certain countries, regulators are also looking at restrictions that could require formal reviews of and/or adjustments to content that appears on our service in their country. In general these regulations impact all services and may make operating in certain jurisdictions more expensive or restrictive as to the content offering we may provide.\n\nHUMAN CAPITAL\n\nWe view our employees and our culture as key to our success. As of December\xa031, 2021, we had approximately 11,300 full-time employees located globally in 60 countries. Of these, 8,600 (76%) were located in the United States and Canada, 1,400 (12%) in Europe, Middle East, and Africa, 400 (4%) in Latin America and 900 (8%) in Asia-Pacific. We also have a number of employees engaged in content production, some of whom are part-time or temporary, and whose numbers fluctuate throughout the year.\n\nWe believe a critical component of our success is our company culture. This culture, which is detailed in a "Culture Memo" located on our website, is often described as a high-performance culture of freedom and responsibility. We aim to attract and retain great people - representing a diverse array of perspectives and skills - to work together as a dream team. We empower all of our employees so that they can have significant impact and input into decision-making; each employee has the freedom and power to make the decisions and take actions in the best interest of the Company in carrying out their role. In return, our employees are responsible and accountable for those decisions and actions. With this approach, we believe we are a more flexible, fun, stimulating, creative, collaborative and successful organization.\n\nAs we have expanded our offices globally, our company culture remains an important aspect of our operations. We have also become mindful of cultural differences across and within regions. Fostering a work environment that is culturally diverse, inclusive and equitable is a major focus for us. We employ a team reporting to our VP of Inclusion Strategy who works to build diversity, inclusion and equity into all aspects of our operations globally, with the goal of having diversity and inclusion function as a critical lens through which each Netflix employee carries out their role. We want more people and cultures to see themselves reflected on screen - so it’s important that our employee base is diverse and represents the communities we serve. Our Inclusion team helps increase representation by training our recruiters on how to hire more inclusively, and to help the company and senior leaders diversify their networks. We also support numerous employee resource groups (ERGs), representing employees and allies from a broad array of historically underrepresented and/or marginalized communities. Our\n\n2', 'Table of Contents\n\nERGs are important in creating a more inclusive environment for all employees, allowing space to connect on shared experiences, providing mentoring, career development and volunteering opportunities. We publish an Inclusion report annually which further highlights our approach to diversity and inclusion, as well as publishing our EEO-1 reports on our website.\n\nWe believe in fostering great leaders. We employ a VP of Leadership Programs, whose team’s mission is to design programs, such as seminars and lectures, that help our leaders (officers, VPs and director-level employees) examine values that guide them personally, and as leaders, especially when those values come into tension with the world around us. The goal of these programs is to create great human beings, who become great leaders, who shape a great company. We also employ a learning and development team that programs workshops to provide skills and coaching to employees on a variety of topics, such as leading and inspiring teams. We believe this focus helps our employees grow as leaders and well-rounded individuals, and better positions Netflix to operate our global business of providing compelling content to entertain the world.\n\nWe aim to pay our employees at the top of their personal market, and they generally are able to choose the form of their compensation between cash and stock options. This permits employee compensation to be highly personalized and reflective of each employee\'s individual needs and preferences. We have conducted pay equity analyses and adopted practices to help ensure that employees from underrepresented groups are not being underpaid based on gender (globally) and race (US) relative to others doing the same or similar work under comparable circumstances. We also practice “open compensation,” which means the top leaders (director-level and above) at the company can see how much any employee is paid. This encourages open discussions about pay disparities throughout the Company. We aim to rectify any pay gaps that we find through these approaches.\n\nWe care about the health and well-being of our employees and their families and provide a variety of benefit programs based on region, including health benefits. In the U.S., each employee receives an annual cash health benefit allowance that they may allocate to medical, dental and vision premiums in a way that makes sense for them. Employees have access to a host of other benefits, including mental health, childcare, family planning and a company match for charitable donations.\n\nWe believe that our approach to human capital resources has been instrumental in our growth, and has made Netflix a desirable destination for employees.\n\nOTHER INFORMATION\n\nWe maintain a website at www.netflix.com. The contents of our website are not incorporated in, or otherwise to be regarded as part of, this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We make available, free of charge on our website, access to our Annual Report on Form 10-K, our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, our Current Reports on Form 8-K and amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), as soon as reasonably practicable after we file or furnish them electronically with the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC").\n\nInvestors and others should note that we announce material financial information to our investors using our investor relations website (ir.netflix.net), SEC filings, press releases, public conference calls and webcasts. We use these channels as well as social media and blogs to communicate with our members and the public about our company, our services and other issues. It is possible that the information we post on social media and blogs could be deemed to be material information. Therefore, we encourage investors, the media, and others interested in our company to review the information we post on the social media channels and blogs listed on our investor relations website.\n\n3', 'Table of Contents\n\nItem 1A.Risk Factors\n\nIf any of the following risks actually occur, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be harmed. In that case, the trading price of our common stock could decline, and you could lose all or part of your investment.\n\nRisks Related to Our Business\n\nIf our efforts to attract and retain members are not successful, our business will be adversely affected.\n\nWe have experienced significant membership growth over the past several years. Our penetration and growth rates vary between the jurisdictions where we provide our service. In countries where we have been operating for many years or where we are highly penetrated, our membership growth is slower than in newer or less penetrated countries. Our ability to continue to attract and retain members will depend in part on our ability to consistently provide our members in countries around the globe with compelling content choices, effectively drive conversation around our content and service, as well as provide a quality experience for choosing and enjoying TV series, documentaries, feature films and mobile games. Furthermore, the relative service levels, content offerings, pricing and related features of competitors to our service may adversely impact our ability to attract and retain memberships. Competitors include other entertainment video providers, such as MVPDs, and streaming entertainment providers (including those that provide pirated content), video gaming providers, as well as user-generated content, and more broadly other sources of entertainment that our members could choose in their moments of free time.\n\nIf consumers do not perceive our service offering to be of value, including if we introduce new or adjust existing features, adjust pricing or service offerings, or change the mix of content in a manner that is not favorably received by them, we may not be able to attract and retain members. We have recently expanded our entertainment video offering to include games. If our efforts to develop and offer games are not valued by our current and future members, our ability to attract and retain members may be negatively impacted. We may, from time to time, adjust our membership pricing, our membership plans, or our pricing model itself, which may not be well-received by consumers, and which may result in existing members canceling our service or fewer new members joining our service. In addition, many of our members rejoin our service or originate from word-of-mouth advertising from existing members. If our efforts to satisfy our existing members are not successful, we may not be able to attract members, and as a result, our ability to maintain and/or grow our business will be adversely affected. Members cancel our service for many reasons, including a perception that they do not use the service sufficiently, the need to cut household expenses, availability of content is unsatisfactory, competitive services provide a better value or experience and customer service issues are not satisfactorily resolved. Membership growth is also impacted by seasonality, with the fourth quarter historically representing our greatest growth, as well as the timing of our content release schedules. We must continually add new memberships both to replace canceled memberships and to grow our business beyond our current membership base. While we currently permit multiple users within the same household to share a single account for non-commercial purposes, if multi-household usage is abused or if our efforts to restrict multi-household usage are ineffective, our ability to add new members may be hindered and our results of operations may be adversely impacted. If we do not grow as expected, given, in particular, that our content costs are largely fixed in nature and contracted over several years, we may not be able to adjust our expenditures or increase our (per membership) revenues commensurate with the lowered growth rate such that our margins, liquidity and results of operation may be adversely impacted. If we are unable to successfully compete with current and new competitors in providing compelling content, retaining our existing memberships and attracting new memberships, our business will be adversely affected.\n\nChanges in competitive offerings for entertainment video could adversely impact our business.\n\nThe market for entertainment video is intensely competitive and subject to rapid change. Through new and existing distribution channels, consumers have increasing options to access entertainment video. The various economic models underlying these channels include subscription, transactional, ad-supported and piracy-based models. All of these have the potential to capture meaningful segments of the entertainment video market. Piracy, in particular, threatens to damage our business, as its fundamental proposition to consumers is so compelling and difficult to compete against: virtually all content for free. Furthermore, in light of the compelling consumer proposition, piracy services are subject to rapid global growth. Traditional providers of entertainment video, including broadcasters and cable network operators, as well as internet based e-commerce or entertainment video providers are increasing their streaming video offerings. Several of these competitors have long operating histories, large customer bases, strong brand recognition, exclusive rights to certain content, large content libraries, and significant financial, marketing and other resources. They may offer more compelling content or secure better terms from suppliers, adopt more aggressive pricing and devote more resources to product development, technology, infrastructure, content acquisitions and marketing. New entrants may enter the market or existing providers may adjust their services with unique offerings or approaches to providing entertainment video. Companies also may enter into business combinations or alliances that strengthen their competitive positions. If we are unable to successfully or profitably compete\n\n4', 'Table of Contents\n\nwith current and new competitors, our business will be adversely affected, and we may not be able to increase or maintain market share, revenues or profitability.\n\nThe ongoing coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic and the various responses to it has disrupted our business, increased our costs, led to delays in content releases and may continue to impact our business and results of operations.\n\nThe ongoing coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic and the various responses to it have created significant volatility, uncertainty and economic disruption. The full extent to which the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and the various responses to it impacts our business, operations and financial results will depend on numerous evolving factors that we may not be able to accurately predict, including: the duration and scope of the pandemic; governmental, business and individuals’ actions that have been and continue to be taken in response to the pandemic; the effect on our members and consumer demand for and ability to pay for our services; disruptions or restrictions on our employees’ ability to work and travel; and any stoppages, disruptions or increased costs associated with our development, production, post-production, marketing and distribution of original programming. Such production pauses have in the past, and may in the future, cause us to delay content releases and temporarily to have less new content available on our service in subsequent quarters. While most of our productions have resumed, certain of our productions continue to experience disruption, as do the productions of our third-party content suppliers. Other partners have similarly had their operations disrupted, including those partners that we use for our operations as well as development, production and post-production of content. Production disruptions can result in additional costs to production, including additional pay to cast and crew. Also, Covid-related delays and production protocols and requirements, including use of PPE and testing, add to costs of production.\n\nWe will continue to actively monitor the issues raised by the COVID-19 pandemic and may take further actions that alter our business operations, including content production, as may be required by federal, state, local or foreign authorities, or that we determine are in the best interests of our employees, members, partners and stockholders. It is not clear what the potential effects any such alterations or modifications may have on our business, including the effects on our members, suppliers or vendors, or on our financial results.\n\nIn addition to the potential direct impacts to our business, the global economy may continue to be impacted as a result of the actions taken in response to COVID-19. To the extent that such a weakened global economy impacts consumers’ ability or willingness to pay for our service or vendors’ ability to provide services to us, especially those related to our content productions, we could see our business and results of operations negatively impacted.\n\nWe face risks, such as unforeseen costs and potential liability in connection with content we acquire, produce, license and/or distribute through our service.\n\nAs a producer and distributor of content, we face potential liability for negligence, copyright and trademark infringement, or other claims based on the nature and content of materials that we acquire, produce, license and/or distribute. We also may face potential liability for content used in promoting our service, including marketing materials. We are devoting more resources toward the development, production, marketing and distribution of original programming, including TV series, documentaries, feature films and mobile games. We believe that original and exclusive programming can help differentiate our service from other offerings, enhance our brand and otherwise attract and retain members. To the extent our programming does not meet our expectations, in particular, in terms of costs, viewing and popularity, our business, including our brand and results of operations may be adversely impacted. As we have expanded our original programming, we have become responsible for production costs and other expenses, such as ongoing guild payments. We also take on risks associated with production, such as completion and key talent risk, which risks have been heightened during Covid-19. Further, negotiations or renewals related to entertainment industry collective bargaining agreements could negatively impact timing and costs associated with our productions. We contract with third parties related to the development, production, marketing and distribution of our original programming.\xa0 We may face potential liability or may suffer significant losses in connection with these arrangements, including but not limited to if such third parties violate applicable law, become insolvent or engage in fraudulent behavior. To the extent we create and sell physical or digital merchandise relating to our programming, and/or license such rights to third parties, we could become subject to product liability, intellectual property or other claims related to such merchandise. We may decide to remove content from our service, not to place licensed or produced content on our service or discontinue or alter production of original content if we believe such content might not be well received by our members, or could be damaging to our brand or business.\n\nTo the extent we do not accurately anticipate costs or mitigate risks, including for content that we obtain but ultimately does not appear on or is removed from our service, or if we become liable for content we acquire, produce, license and/or distribute, our business may suffer. Litigation to defend these claims could be costly and the expenses and damages arising\n\n5', 'Table of Contents\n\nfrom any liability or unforeseen production risks could harm our results of operations. We may not be indemnified against claims or costs of these types and we may not have insurance coverage for these types of claims.\n\nIf we are not able to manage change and growth, our business could be adversely affected.\n\nWe are expanding our operations internationally, scaling our streaming service to effectively and reliably handle anticipated growth in both members and features related to our service, as well as scaling our ability to program and produce original content, introducing games on our service. As our international offering evolves, we are managing and adjusting our business to address varied content offerings, consumer customs and practices, in particular those dealing with e-commerce and streaming video, as well as differing legal and regulatory environments. As we scale our streaming service, we are developing technology and utilizing third-party “cloud” computing services. As we scale our content production, including now games, we are building out expertise in a number of disciplines, including creative, marketing, legal, finance, licensing, merchandising and other resources related to the development and physical production of content. Further, we may expand our content offering in a manner that is not well received by consumers. As we grow our operations, we may face integration and operational challenges as well as potential unknown liabilities and reputational concerns in connection with partners we work with or companies we may acquire or control. If we are not able to manage the growing complexity of our business, including improving, refining or revising our corporate culture as well as our systems and operational practices related to our streaming operations and original content, our business may be adversely affected.\n\nIf we fail to maintain or, in newer markets establish, a positive reputation concerning our service, including the content we offer, we may not be able to attract or retain members, and our operating results may be adversely affected.\n\nWe believe that a positive reputation concerning our service is important in attracting and retaining members. To the extent our content, in particular, our original programming, is perceived as low quality, offensive or otherwise not compelling to consumers, our ability to establish and maintain a positive reputation may be adversely impacted. To the extent our content is deemed controversial or offensive by government regulators, we may face direct or indirect retaliatory action or behavior, including being required to remove such content from our service, our entire service could be banned and/or become subject to heightened regulatory scrutiny across our business and operations. We could also face boycotts which could adversely affect our business. Furthermore, to the extent our response to government action or our marketing, customer service and public relations efforts are not effective or result in negative reaction, our ability to establish and maintain a positive reputation may likewise be adversely impacted. With newer markets, we also need to establish our reputation with consumers and to the extent we are not successful in creating positive impressions, our business in these newer markets may be adversely impacted.\n\nOur business could be adversely impacted by costs and challenges associated with strategic acquisitions and investments.\n\nFrom time to time, we acquire or invest in businesses, content, and technologies that support our business. The risks associated with such acquisitions or investments include the difficulty of integrating solutions, operations, and personnel; inheriting liabilities and exposure to litigation; failure to realize anticipated benefits and expected synergies; and diversion of management’s time and attention, among other acquisition-related risks.\n\nWe may not be successful in overcoming such risks, and such acquisitions and investments may negatively impact our business. In addition, if we do not complete an announced acquisition transaction or integrate an acquired business successfully and in a timely manner, we may not realize the benefits of the acquisition to the extent anticipated. Acquisitions and investments may contribute to fluctuations in our quarterly financial results. These fluctuations could arise from transaction-related costs and charges associated with eliminating redundant expenses or write-offs of impaired assets recorded in connection with acquisitions and investments, and could negatively impact our financial results.\n\nWe rely upon a number of partners to make our service available on their devices.\n\nWe currently offer members the ability to receive streaming content through a host of internet-connected devices, including TVs, digital video players, TV set-top boxes and mobile devices. We have agreements with various cable, satellite and telecommunications operators to make our service available through the TV set-top boxes of these service providers, some of which compete directly with us or have investments in competing streaming content providers. In many instances, our agreements also include provisions by which the partner bills consumers directly for the Netflix service or otherwise offers services or products in connection with offering our service. If partners or other providers do a better job of connecting consumers with content they want to watch, for example through multi-service discovery interfaces, our service may be adversely impacted. We intend to continue to broaden our relationships with existing partners and to increase our capability to stream TV series, documentaries and feature films to other platforms and partners over time. If we are not successful in maintaining existing and creating new relationships, or if we encounter technological, content licensing, regulatory, business or\n\n6', "Table of Contents\n\nother impediments to delivering our streaming content to our members via these devices, our ability to retain members and grow our business could be adversely impacted.\n\nOur agreements with our partners are typically between one and three years in duration and our business could be adversely affected if, upon expiration, a number of our partners do not continue to provide access to our service or are unwilling to do so on terms acceptable to us, which terms may include the degree of accessibility and prominence of our service. Furthermore, devices are manufactured and sold by entities other than Netflix and while these entities should be responsible for the devices’ performance, the connection between these devices and our service may nonetheless result in consumer dissatisfaction toward us and such dissatisfaction could result in claims against us or otherwise adversely impact our business. In addition, technology changes to our streaming functionality may require that partners update their devices, or may lead to us to stop supporting the delivery of our service on certain legacy devices. If partners do not update or otherwise modify their devices, or if we discontinue support for certain devices, our service and our members' use and enjoyment could be negatively impacted.\n\nWe are subject to payment processing risk.\n\nOur members pay for our service using a variety of different payment methods, including credit and debit cards, gift cards, prepaid cards, direct debit, online wallets and direct carrier and partner billing. We rely on internal systems and those of third parties to process payment. Acceptance and processing of these payment methods are subject to certain rules, regulations, and industry standards, including additional authentication requirements for certain payment methods, and require payment of interchange and other fees. To the extent there are increases in payment processing fees, material changes in the payment ecosystem, such as large re-issuances of payment cards, delays in receiving payments from payment processors, changes to rules, regulations or industry standards concerning payments, loss of payment partners and/or disruptions or failures in our payment processing systems, partner systems or payment products, including products we use to update payment information, our revenue, operating expenses and results of operation could be adversely impacted. In certain instances, we leverage third parties such as our cable and other partners to bill subscribers on our behalf. If these third parties become unwilling or unable to continue processing payments on our behalf, we would have to transition subscribers or otherwise find alternative methods of collecting payments, which could adversely impact member acquisition and retention. In addition, from time to time, we encounter fraudulent use of payment methods, which could impact our results of operations and if not adequately controlled and managed could create negative consumer perceptions of our service. If we are unable to maintain our fraud and chargeback rate at acceptable levels, card networks may impose fines, our card approval rate may be impacted and we may be subject to additional card authentication requirements. The termination of our ability to process payments on any major payment method would significantly impair our ability to operate our business.\n\nIf government regulations relating to the internet or other areas of our business change, we may need to alter the manner in which we conduct our business, or incur greater operating expenses.\n\nThe adoption or modification of laws or regulations relating to the internet or other areas of our business could limit or otherwise adversely affect the manner in which we currently conduct our business. As our service and others like us gain traction in international markets, governments are increasingly looking to introduce new or extend legacy regulations to these services, in particular those related to broadcast media and tax. For example, European law enables individual member states to impose levies and other financial obligations on media operators located outside their jurisdiction. Several jurisdictions have and others may, over time, impose financial and regulatory obligations on us. In addition, the continued growth and development of the market for online commerce may lead to more stringent consumer protection laws, which may impose additional burdens on us. If we are required to comply with new regulations or legislation or new interpretations of existing regulations or legislation, this compliance could cause us to incur additional expenses or alter our business model.\n\nChanges in laws or regulations that adversely affect the growth, popularity or use of the internet, including laws impacting net neutrality, could decrease the demand for our service and increase our cost of doing business. Certain laws intended to prevent network operators from discriminating against the legal traffic that traverse their networks have been implemented in many countries, including across the European Union. In others, the laws may be nascent or non-existent. Furthermore, favorable laws may change, including for example, in the United States where net neutrality regulations were repealed. Given uncertainty around these rules, including changing interpretations, amendments or repeal, coupled with potentially significant political and economic power of local network operators, we could experience discriminatory or anti-competitive practices that could impede our growth, cause us to incur additional expense or otherwise negatively affect our business.\n\nWe are engaged in legal proceedings that could cause us to incur unforeseen expenses and could occupy a significant amount of our management's time and attention.\n\n7", "Table of Contents\n\nFrom time to time, we are subject to litigation or claims that could negatively affect our business operations and financial position. As we have grown, we have seen a rise in the number of litigation matters against us. These matters have included copyright and other claims related to our content, patent infringement claims, tax litigation, employment related litigation, as well as consumer and securities class actions, each of which are typically expensive to defend. Litigation disputes could cause us to incur unforeseen expenses, result in content unavailability, service disruptions, and otherwise occupy a significant amount of our management's time and attention, any of which could negatively affect our business operations and financial position. We also from time to time receive inquiries and subpoenas and other types of information requests from government authorities and we may become subject to related claims and other actions related to our business activities. While the ultimate outcome of investigations, inquiries, information requests and related legal proceedings is difficult to predict, such matters can be expensive, time-consuming and distracting, and adverse resolutions or settlements of those matters may result in, among other things, modification of our business practices, reputational harm or costs and significant payments, any of which could negatively affect our business operations and financial position.\n\nRisks Related to Intellectual Property\n\nIf studios, content providers or other rights holders refuse to license streaming content or other rights upon terms acceptable to us, our business could be adversely affected.\n\nOur ability to provide our members with content they can watch depends on obtaining various rights from third parties upon terms acceptable to us, including distribution rights, to such content and certain related elements thereof, such as the public performance of music contained within the content we distribute. The license periods and the terms and conditions of such rights vary. As content providers develop their own streaming services, they may be unwilling to provide us with access to certain content, including popular series or movies. If the studios, content providers and other rights holders are not or are no longer willing or able to license us content upon terms acceptable to us, our ability to stream content to our members may be adversely affected and/or our costs could increase. Certain licenses for content provide for the studios or other content providers to withdraw content from our service relatively quickly. Because of these provisions and other actions we may take, content available through our service can be withdrawn on short notice. As competition increases, we see the cost of certain programming increase. As we seek to differentiate our service, we are often focused on securing certain exclusive rights when obtaining content, including original content. We are also focused on programming an overall mix of content that delights our members in a cost efficient manner. Within this context, we are selective about the titles we add and renew to our service. If we do not maintain a compelling mix of content, our membership acquisition and retention may be adversely affected.\n\nMusic and certain authors’ performances contained within content we distribute may require us to obtain licenses for such distribution. In this regard, we engage in negotiations with collection management organizations (“CMOs”) and similar entities that hold certain rights to music and/or other interests in intellectual property (e.g. remuneration rights) in connection with streaming content into various territories. If we are unable to reach mutually acceptable terms with these organizations, we could become involved in litigation and/or could be enjoined from distributing certain content, which could adversely impact our business. Additionally, pending and ongoing litigation and negotiations between certain CMOs and other third parties in various territories could adversely impact our negotiations with CMOs, or result in music publishers represented by certain CMOs unilaterally withdrawing rights, and thereby adversely impact our ability to reach licensing agreements reasonably acceptable to us. Failure to reach such licensing agreements could expose us to potential liability for copyright infringement or otherwise increase our costs. Additionally, as the market for the digital distribution of content grows, a broader role for CMOs in the remuneration of authors, performers and other beneficiaries of neighboring rights could expose us to greater distribution expenses.\n\nIf our trademarks and other proprietary rights are not adequately protected to prevent use or appropriation by third parties, the value of our brand and other intangible assets may be diminished, and our business may be adversely affected.\n\nWe rely and expect to continue to rely on a combination of confidentiality and license agreements with our employees, consultants and third parties with whom we have relationships, as well as trademark, copyright, patent and trade secret protection laws, to protect our proprietary rights. We may also seek to enforce our proprietary rights through court proceedings or other legal actions. We have filed and we expect to file from time to time for trademark and patent applications. Nevertheless, these applications may not be approved, third parties may challenge any copyrights, patents or trademarks issued to or held by us, third parties may knowingly or unknowingly infringe our intellectual property rights, and we may not be able to prevent infringement or misappropriation without substantial expense to us. If the protection of our intellectual property rights is inadequate to prevent use or misappropriation by third parties, the value of our brand, content, and other intangible assets may be diminished, competitors may be able to more effectively mimic our service and methods of operations, the\n\n8", 'Table of Contents\n\nperception of our business and service to members and potential members may become confused in the marketplace, and our ability to attract members may be adversely affected.\n\nWe currently hold various domain names relating to our brand, including Netflix.com. Failure to protect our domain names could adversely affect our reputation and brand and make it more difficult for users to find our website and our service. We may be unable, without significant cost or at all, to prevent third parties from acquiring domain names that are similar to, infringe upon or otherwise decrease the value of our trademarks and other proprietary rights.\n\nIntellectual property claims against us could be costly and result in the loss of significant rights related to, among other things, our website, streaming technology, our recommendation and merchandising technology, title selection processes, our content, and marketing activities.\n\nTrademark, copyright, patent and other intellectual property rights are important to us and other companies. Our intellectual property rights extend to our technology, business processes and the content we produce and distribute through our service. We use the intellectual property of third parties in creating some of our content, merchandising our products and marketing our service. From time to time, third parties allege that we have infringed or otherwise violated their intellectual property rights. If we are unable to obtain sufficient rights, successfully defend our use, or develop non-infringing technology or otherwise alter our business practices on a timely basis in response to claims against us for infringement, misappropriation, misuse or other violation of third-party intellectual property rights, our business and competitive position may be adversely affected. Many companies are devoting significant resources to developing patents that could potentially affect many aspects of our business. There are numerous patents that broadly claim means and methods of conducting business on the internet. We have not searched patents relative to our technology. Defending ourselves against intellectual property claims, whether they are with or without merit or are determined in our favor, results in costly litigation and diversion of technical and management personnel. It also may result in our inability to use our current website, streaming technology, our recommendation and merchandising technology or inability to market our service or merchandise our products. We may also have to remove content from our service, or remove consumer products or marketing materials from the marketplace. As a result of a dispute, we may have to develop non-infringing technology, enter into royalty or licensing agreements, adjust our content, merchandising or marketing activities or take other actions to resolve the claims. These actions, if required, may be costly or unavailable on terms acceptable to us.\n\nRisks Related to Information Technology\n\nAny significant disruption in or unauthorized access to our computer systems or those of third parties that we utilize in our operations, including those relating to cybersecurity or arising from cyber-attacks, could result in a loss or degradation of service, unauthorized disclosure of data, including member and corporate information, or theft of intellectual property, including digital content assets, which could adversely impact our business.\n\nOur reputation and ability to attract, retain and serve our members is dependent upon the reliable performance and security of our computer systems and those of third parties that we utilize in our operations. These systems may be subject to damage or interruption from, among other things, earthquakes, adverse weather conditions, other natural disasters, terrorist attacks, rogue employees, power loss, telecommunications failures, and cybersecurity risks. Interruptions in these systems, or with the internet in general, could make our service unavailable or degraded or otherwise hinder our ability to deliver our service. Service interruptions, errors in our software or the unavailability of computer systems used in our operations could diminish the overall attractiveness of our membership service to existing and potential members.\n\nOur computer systems and those of third parties we use in our operations are subject to cybersecurity threats, including cyber-attacks such as computer viruses, denial of service attacks, physical or electronic break-ins and similar disruptions. These systems periodically experience directed attacks intended to lead to interruptions and delays in our service and operations as well as loss, misuse or theft of personal information (of third parties, employees, and our members) and other data, confidential information or intellectual property. Additionally, outside parties may attempt to induce employees, vendors, partners, or users to disclose sensitive or confidential information in order to gain access to data. Any attempt by hackers to obtain our data (including member and corporate information) or intellectual property (including digital content assets), disrupt our service, or otherwise access our systems, or those of third parties we use, if successful, could harm our business, be expensive to remedy and damage our reputation. We have implemented certain systems and processes to thwart hackers and protect our data and systems. However, the techniques used to gain unauthorized access to data and software are constantly evolving, and we may be unable to anticipate, detect or prevent unauthorized access or address all cybersecurity incidents that occur. Because of our prominence, we (and/or third parties we use) may be a particularly attractive target for such attacks, and from time to time, we have experienced an unauthorized release of certain digital content assets. However, to date these unauthorized releases have not had a material impact on our service, systems or business. There is no assurance that hackers may not have a material impact on our service or systems in the future. Our insurance does not cover expenses related to such disruptions or unauthorized access. Efforts to prevent hackers from disrupting our service or otherwise accessing our systems\n\n9', 'Table of Contents\n\nare expensive to develop, implement and maintain. These efforts require ongoing monitoring and updating as technologies change and efforts to overcome security measures become more sophisticated, and may limit the functionality of or otherwise negatively impact our service offering and systems. Any significant disruption to our service or access to our systems could result in a loss of memberships and adversely affect our business and results of operation. Further, a penetration of our systems or a third-party’s systems or other misappropriation or misuse of personal information could subject us to business, regulatory, litigation and reputation risk, which could have a negative effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\nWe utilize our own communications and computer hardware systems located either in our facilities or in that of a third-party provider. In addition, we utilize third-party “cloud” computing services in connection with our business operations. We also utilize our own and third-party content delivery networks to help us stream TV series, documentaries and feature films and offer mobile games in high volume to Netflix members over the internet. Problems faced by us or our third-party “cloud” computing or other network providers, including technological or business-related disruptions, as well as cybersecurity threats and regulatory interference, could adversely impact the experience of our members.\n\nWe rely upon Amazon Web Services to operate certain aspects of our service and any disruption of or interference with our use of the Amazon Web Services operation would impact our operations and our business would be adversely impacted.\n\nAmazon Web Services (“AWS”) provides a distributed computing infrastructure platform for business operations, or what is commonly referred to as a "cloud" computing service. We have architected our software and computer systems so as to utilize data processing, storage capabilities and other services provided by AWS. Currently, we run the vast majority of our computing on AWS. Given this, along with the fact that we cannot easily switch our AWS operations to another cloud provider, any disruption of or interference with our use of AWS would impact our operations and our business would be adversely impacted. While the retail side of Amazon competes with us, we do not believe that Amazon will use the AWS operation in such a manner as to gain competitive advantage against our service, although if it were to do so it could harm our business.\n\nIf the technology we use in operating our business fails, is unavailable, or does not operate to expectations, our business and results of operation could be adversely impacted.\n\nWe utilize a combination of proprietary and third-party technology to operate our business. This includes the technology that we have developed to recommend and merchandise content to our consumers as well as enable fast and efficient delivery of content to our members and their various consumer electronic devices. For example, we have built and deployed our own content-delivery network (“CDN”). To the extent Internet Service Providers (“ISPs”) do not interconnect with our CDN or charge us to access their networks, or if we experience difficulties in our CDN’s operation, our ability to efficiently and effectively deliver our streaming content to our members could be adversely impacted and our business and results of operation could be adversely affected. Likewise, if our recommendation and merchandising technology does not enable us to predict and recommend titles that our members will enjoy, our ability to attract and retain members may be adversely affected. We also utilize third-party technology to help market our service, process payments, and otherwise manage the daily operations of our business. If our technology or that of third-parties we utilize in our operations fails or otherwise operates improperly, including as a result of “bugs” or other errors in our development and deployment of software, our ability to operate our service, retain existing members and add new members may be impaired. Any harm to our members’ devices caused by software used in our operations could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\n\nChanges in how network operators handle and charge for access to data that travel across their networks could adversely impact our business.\n\nWe rely upon the ability of consumers to access our service through the internet. If network operators block, restrict or otherwise impair access to our service over their networks, our service and business could be negatively affected. To the extent that network operators implement usage based pricing, including meaningful bandwidth caps, or otherwise try to monetize access to their networks by data providers, we could incur greater operating expenses and our membership acquisition and retention could be negatively impacted. Furthermore, to the extent network operators create tiers of internet access service and either charge us for or prohibit us from being available through these tiers, our business could be negatively impacted.\n\nMost network operators that provide consumers with access to the internet also provide these consumers with multichannel video programming. As such, many network operators have an incentive to use their network infrastructure in a manner adverse to our continued growth and success. While we believe that consumer demand, regulatory oversight and competition will help check these incentives, to the extent that network operators are able to provide preferential treatment to their data as opposed to ours or otherwise implement discriminatory network management practices, our business could be negatively impacted. The extent to which these incentives limit operator behavior differs across markets.\n\n10', 'Table of Contents\n\nRisks Related to Privacy\n\nPrivacy concerns could limit our ability to collect and leverage member personal information and other data and disclosure of member personal information and other data could adversely impact our business and reputation.\n\nIn the ordinary course of business and in particular in connection with content acquisition and merchandising our service to our members, we collect and utilize information supplied by our members, which may include personal information and other data. We are subject to laws, rules and regulations in the U.S. and in other countries relating to privacy and the collection, use and security of personal information, including but not limited to Regulation (EU) 2016/679 (also known as the General Data Protection Regulation or “GDPR”) and the California Privacy Rights Act ("CPRA"). Any actual or perceived failure to comply with the GDPR, the CCPA/CPRA, other data privacy laws or regulations, or related contractual or other obligations, or any perceived privacy rights violation, could lead to investigations, claims, and proceedings by governmental entities and private parties, damages for contract breach, and other significant costs, penalties, and other liabilities, as well as harm to our reputation and market position.\n\nOther businesses have been criticized by privacy groups and governmental bodies for attempts to link personal identities and other information to data collected on the internet regarding users’ browsing and other habits. Increased regulation of data utilization practices, including self-regulation or findings under existing laws that limit our ability to collect, transfer and use information and other data, could have an adverse effect on our business. In addition, if we were to disclose information and other data about our members in a manner that was objectionable to them, our business reputation could be adversely affected, and we could face potential legal claims that could impact our operating results. Internationally, we may become subject to additional and/or more stringent legal obligations concerning our treatment of member and other personal information, such as laws regarding data localization and/or restrictions on data export. Failure to comply with these obligations could subject us to liability, and to the extent that we need to alter our business model or practices to adapt to these obligations, we could incur additional expenses.\n\nOur reputation and relationships with members would be harmed if member personal information and other data, particularly billing data, were to be accessed by unauthorized persons.\n\nWe maintain personal information and other data regarding our members, including names and billing information. This information and data is maintained on our own systems as well as that of third parties we use in our operations. With respect to billing information, such as credit card numbers, we rely on encryption and authentication technology to secure such information. We take measures to protect against unauthorized intrusion into our members’ information and other data. Despite these measures and technologies we, our payment processing services or other third-party services we use such as AWS, could experience an unauthorized intrusion into our members’ information and other data. In the event of such a breach, current and potential members may become unwilling to provide the information to us necessary for them to remain or become members. We also may be required to notify regulators about any actual or perceived data breach (including various state Attorneys General, one or more EU data protection authorities, or other data protection authorities) as well as the individuals who are affected by the incident within strict time periods. Additionally, we could face legal claims or regulatory fines or penalties for such a breach. The costs relating to any data breach could be material, and we currently do not carry insurance against the risk of a data breach. We also maintain personal information and other data concerning our employees, as well as personal information of others working on our productions. Should an unauthorized intrusion into our members’ or employees’ personal information and other data and/or production personal information occur, our business could be adversely affected and our larger reputation with respect to data protection could be negatively impacted.\n\nRisks Related to Liquidity\n\nThe long-term and largely fixed cost nature of our content commitments may limit our operating flexibility and could adversely affect our liquidity and results of operations.\n\nIn connection with licensing streaming content, we typically enter into multi-year commitments with studios and other content providers. We also enter into multi-year commitments for content that we produce, either directly or through third parties, including elements associated with these productions such as non-cancelable commitments under talent agreements. The payment terms of these agreements are not tied to member usage or the size of our membership base (“fixed cost”) but may be determined by costs of production or tied to such factors as titles licensed and/or theatrical exhibition receipts. Such commitments, to the extent estimable under accounting standards, are included in the Contractual Obligations section of Part II, Item 7, "Management\'s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" and Note 7, Commitments and Contingencies in the accompanying notes to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8, "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Given the multiple-year duration and largely fixed cost nature of content commitments, if membership acquisition and retention do not meet our expectations, our margins may be\n\n11', 'Table of Contents\n\nadversely impacted. Payment terms for certain content commitments, such as content we directly produce, will typically require more up-front cash payments than other content licenses or arrangements whereby we do not cashflow the production of such content. To the extent membership and/or revenue growth do not meet our expectations, our liquidity and results of operations could be adversely affected as a result of content commitments and accelerated payment requirements of certain agreements. In addition, the long-term and fixed cost nature of our content commitments may limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to changes in our business and the market segments in which we operate. If we license and/or produce content that is not favorably received by consumers in a territory, or is unable to be shown in a territory, acquisition and retention may be adversely impacted and given the long-term and fixed cost nature of our content commitments, we may not be able to adjust our content offering quickly and our results of operation may be adversely impacted.\n\nWe may seek additional capital that may result in stockholder dilution or that may have rights senior to those of our common stockholders.\n\nFrom time to time, we may seek to obtain additional capital, either through equity, equity-linked or debt securities. For several years prior to 2020, our cash flows from operations were negative and to the extent that it becomes negative in the future we may need to seek additional capital. The decision to obtain additional capital will depend on, among other things, our business plans, operating performance and condition of the capital markets. Any disruption in the capital markets could make it more difficult and expensive for us to raise additional capital or refinance our existing indebtedness. If we raise additional funds through the issuance of equity, equity-linked or debt securities, those securities may have rights, preferences or privileges senior to the rights of our common stock, and our stockholders may experience dilution. Any large equity or equity-linked offering could also negatively impact our stock price.\n\nWe have a substantial amount of indebtedness and other obligations, including streaming content obligations, which could adversely affect our financial position.\n\nWe have a substantial amount of indebtedness and other obligations, including streaming content obligations. Moreover, we may incur additional indebtedness in the future and incur other obligations, including additional streaming content obligations. If the financial markets become difficult or costly to access, our ability to raise additional capital may be negatively impacted. As of December\xa031, 2021, we had the equivalent of $15.5 billion aggregate principal amount of senior notes outstanding (“Notes”), some of which is denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. In addition, we have entered into a revolving credit agreement that provides for a $1 billion unsecured revolving credit facility. As of December\xa031, 2021, we have not borrowed any amount under this revolving credit facility. As of December\xa031, 2021, we had approximately $7.4 billion of total content liabilities as reflected on our consolidated balance sheet, some of which is denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Such amount does not include streaming content commitments that do not meet the criteria for liability recognition, the amounts of which are significant. For more information on our streaming content obligations, including those not on our consolidated balance sheet, see Note 7, Commitments and Contingencies in the accompanying notes to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8, "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Our substantial indebtedness and other obligations, including streaming content obligations, may:\n\n•make it difficult for us to satisfy our financial obligations, including making scheduled principal and interest payments on our Notes and our other obligations;\n\n•limit our ability to borrow additional funds, if needed, for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions or other general business purposes;\n\n•increase our cost of borrowing;\n\n•limit our ability to use our cash flow or obtain additional financing for future working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions or other general business purposes;\n\n•require us to use a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to make debt service payments and pay our other obligations when due;\n\n•limit our flexibility to plan for, or react to, changes in our business and industry;\n\n•place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our less leveraged competitors; and\n\n•increase our vulnerability to the impact of adverse economic and industry conditions, including changes in interest rates and foreign exchange rates.\n\nOur streaming obligations include large multi-year commitments. As a result, we may be unable to react to any downturn in the economy or reduction in our cash flows from operations by reducing our streaming content obligations in the near-term. This could result in our needing to access the capital markets at an unfavorable time, which may negatively impact our stock price.\n\n12', 'Table of Contents\n\nWe may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service our debt and other obligations.\n\nOur ability to make payments on our debt, including our Notes, and our other obligations will depend on our financial and operating performance, which is subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions and to certain financial, business and other factors beyond our control. For several years prior to 2020, our cash flows from operations were negative. We may be unable to attain a level of cash flows from operating activities sufficient to permit us to pay the principal, premium, if any, and interest on our debt, including the Notes, and other obligations, including amounts due under our streaming content obligations.\n\nIf we are unable to service our debt and other obligations from cash flows, we may need to refinance or restructure all or a portion of such obligations prior to maturity. Our ability to refinance or restructure our debt and other obligations will depend upon the condition of the capital markets and our financial condition at such time. Any refinancing or restructuring could be at higher interest rates and may require us to comply with more onerous covenants, which could further restrict our business operations. If our cash flows are insufficient to service our debt and other obligations, we may not be able to refinance or restructure any of these obligations on commercially reasonable terms or at all and any refinancing or restructuring could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition.\n\nIf our cash flows are insufficient to fund our debt and other obligations and we are unable to refinance or restructure these obligations, we could face substantial liquidity problems and may be forced to reduce or delay investments and capital expenditures, or to sell material assets or operations to meet our debt and other obligations. We cannot assure you that we would be able to implement any of these alternative measures on satisfactory terms or at all or that the proceeds from such alternatives would be adequate to meet any debt or other obligations when due. If it becomes necessary to implement any of these alternative measures, our business, results of operations, or financial condition could be materially and adversely affected.\n\nRisks Related to International Operations\n\nWe could be subject to economic, political, regulatory and other risks arising from our international operations.\n\nOperating in international markets requires significant resources and management attention and will subject us to economic, political, regulatory and other risks that may be different from or incremental to those in the U.S. In addition to the risks that we face in the U.S., our international operations involve risks that could adversely affect our business, including:\n\n•the need to adapt our content and user interfaces for specific cultural and language differences;\n\n•difficulties and costs associated with staffing and managing foreign operations;\n\n•political or social unrest and economic instability;\n\n•compliance with laws such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, UK Bribery Act and other anti-corruption laws, export controls and economic sanctions, and local laws prohibiting corrupt payments to government officials;\n\n•difficulties in understanding and complying with local laws, regulations and customs in foreign jurisdictions, including local ownership requirements for streaming content providers;\n\n•regulatory requirements or government action against our service, whether in response to enforcement of actual or purported legal and regulatory requirements or otherwise, that results in disruption or non-availability of our service or particular content in the applicable jurisdiction;\n\n•foreign intellectual property laws, such as the EU copyright directive, or changes to such laws, which may be less favorable than U.S. law and, among other issues, may impact the economics of creating or distributing content, anti-piracy efforts, or our ability to protect or exploit intellectual property rights;\n\n•adverse tax consequences such as those related to changes in tax laws or tax rates or their interpretations, and the related application of judgment in determining our global provision for income taxes, deferred tax assets or liabilities or other tax liabilities given the ultimate tax determination is uncertain;\n\n•fluctuations in currency exchange rates, which we do not use foreign exchange contracts or derivatives to hedge against and which will impact revenues and expenses of our international operations and expose us to foreign currency exchange rate risk;\n\n•profit repatriation and other restrictions on the transfer of funds;\n\n•differing payment processing systems as well as consumer use and acceptance of electronic payment methods, such as payment cards;\n\n•new and different sources of competition;\n\n13', 'Table of Contents\n\n•censorship requirements that cause us to remove or edit popular content, leading to consumer disappointment, brand tarnishment or dissatisfaction with our service;\n\n•low usage and/or penetration of internet-connected consumer electronic devices;\n\n•different and more stringent user protection, data protection, privacy and other laws, including data localization and/or restrictions on data export, and local ownership requirements;\n\n•availability of reliable broadband connectivity and wide area networks in targeted areas for expansion;\n\n•differing, and often more lenient, laws and consumer understanding/attitudes regarding the illegality of piracy;\n\n•negative impacts from trade disputes; and\n\n•implementation of regulations designed to stimulate the local production of film and TV series in order to promote and preserve local culture and economic activity, including local content quotas, investment obligations, and levies to support local film funds. For example, the European Union revised its Audio Visual Media Services Directive in 2018 to require that European works comprise at least thirty percent (30%) of media service providers’ catalogs, and to require prominence of those works.\n\nOur failure to manage any of these risks successfully could harm our international operations and our overall business, and results of our operations.\n\nWe are subject to taxation related risks in multiple jurisdictions.\n\nWe are a U.S.-based multinational company subject to tax in multiple U.S. and foreign tax jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in determining our global provision for income taxes, deferred tax assets or liabilities and in evaluating our tax positions on a worldwide basis. While we believe our tax positions are consistent with the tax laws in the jurisdictions in which we conduct our business, it is possible that these positions may be challenged by jurisdictional tax authorities, which may have a significant impact on our global provision for taxes.\n\nTax laws are being re-examined and evaluated globally. New laws and interpretations of the law are taken into account for financial statement purposes in the quarter or year that they become applicable. Tax authorities are increasingly scrutinizing the tax positions of companies and we have tax audits pending in several jurisdictions. The U.S. federal and state governments, countries in the European Union, as well as a number of other countries and organizations such as the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, are actively considering changes to existing tax laws that, if enacted, could increase our tax obligations in jurisdictions where we do business. If U.S. or other foreign tax authorities change applicable tax laws or successfully challenge how or where our profits are currently recognized, our overall taxes could increase, and our business, financial condition or results of operations may be adversely impacted.\n\nRisks Related to Human Resources\n\nWe may lose key employees or may be unable to hire qualified employees.\n\nWe rely on the continued service of our senior management, including our Co-Chief Executive Officers, Reed Hastings and Ted Sarandos, members of our executive team and other key employees and the hiring of new qualified employees. In our industry, there is substantial and continuous competition for highly-skilled business, product development, technical, creative and other personnel. If we experience high executive turnover, fail to adapt our business practices to industry expectations, fail to implement succession plans for key employees, are not successful in recruiting new personnel or in retaining and motivating existing personnel, in instilling our culture in new employees, or improving our culture as we grow, our operations may be disrupted.\n\nLabor disputes may have an adverse effect on the Company’s business.\n\nOur partners, suppliers, vendors and we employ the services of writers, directors, actors and other talent as well as trade employees and others who are subject to collective bargaining agreements in the motion picture industry, both in the U.S. and internationally. Expiring collective bargaining agreements may be renewed on terms that are unfavorable to us. If expiring collective bargaining agreements cannot be renewed, then it is possible that the affected unions could take action in the form of strikes or work stoppages. Such actions, as well as higher costs or operating complexities in connection with these collective bargaining agreements or a significant labor dispute, could have an adverse effect on our business by causing delays in production, added costs or by reducing profit margins.\n\n14', 'Table of Contents\n\nRisks Related to Our Stock Ownership\n\nProvisions in our charter documents and under Delaware law could discourage a takeover that stockholders may consider favorable, although we have announced plans to modify some of these provisions over time..\n\nOur charter documents in their current form may discourage, delay or prevent a merger or acquisition that a stockholder may consider favorable because they:\n\n•authorize our board of directors, without stockholder approval, to issue up to 10,000,000 shares of undesignated preferred stock;\n\n•provide for a classified board of directors;\n\n•prohibit our stockholders from acting by written consent;\n\n•establish advance notice requirements for proposing matters to be approved by stockholders at stockholder meetings; and\n\n•prohibit stockholders from calling a special meeting of stockholders.\n\nWe have announced plans to eliminate the classified structure of our board of directors, subject to stockholder approval which may not be forthcoming, and also to revise the current director election standard, and to permit holders of our stock to call a special meeting of stockholders.\n\nAs a Delaware corporation, we are also subject to certain Delaware anti-takeover provisions. Under Delaware law, a corporation may not engage in a business combination with any holder of 15% or more of its capital stock unless the holder has held the stock for three years or, among other things, the board of directors has approved the transaction. Our board of directors could rely on Delaware law to prevent or delay an acquisition of us.\n\nIn addition, a merger or acquisition may trigger retention payments to certain executive employees under the terms of our Amended and Restated Executive Severance and Retention Incentive Plan, thereby increasing the cost of such a transaction.\n\nOur stock price is volatile.\n\nThe price at which our common stock has traded has fluctuated significantly. The price may continue to be volatile due to a number of factors including the following, some of which are beyond our control:\n\n•variations in our operating results, including our membership acquisition and retention, revenues, operating income, net income, net cash provided by operating activities and free cash flow;\n\n•variations between our actual operating results and the expectations of securities analysts, investors and the financial community;\n\n•announcements of developments affecting our business, systems or expansion plans by us or others;\n\n•competition, including the introduction of new competitors, their pricing strategies and services;\n\n•market volatility in general;\n\n•the level of demand for our stock, including the amount of short interest in our stock;\n\n•the impact of our current stock repurchase program and any future stock repurchase program we may adopt;\n\n•the operating results of our competitors; and\n\n•other risks and uncertainties described in these risk factors.\n\nAs a result of these and other factors, investors in our common stock may not be able to resell their shares at or above their original purchase price.\n\nFollowing certain periods of volatility in the market price of our securities, we became the subject of securities litigation. We may experience more such litigation following future periods of volatility. This type of litigation may result in substantial costs and a diversion of management’s attention and resources.\n\nPreparing and forecasting our financial results requires us to make judgments and estimates which may differ materially from actual results.\n\nGiven the dynamic nature of our business, and the inherent limitations in predicting the future, forecasts of our revenues, operating margins, net income and number of paid membership additions and other financial and operating data may differ materially from actual results. Such discrepancies could cause a decline in the trading price of our common stock. In addition, the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United\n\n15', 'Table of Contents\n\nStates of America also requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported periods. We base such estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, but actual results may differ from these estimates. For example, we estimate the content amortization pattern, beginning with the month of first availability, of any particular licensed or produced television series, documentary or feature film based upon various factors including historical and estimated viewing patterns. If actual viewing patterns differ from these estimates, the pattern and/or period of amortization would be changed and could affect the timing or recognition of content amortization. If we revise such estimates it could result in greater in-period expenses, which could cause us to miss our earnings guidance or negatively impact the results we report which could negatively impact our stock price. Further, events outside of our control may cause actual results to differ from our forecast. For example, the COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted historical acquisition and retention patterns, and has made forecasting more difficult.\n\nItem 1B.Unresolved Staff Comments\n\nNone.\n\n16', 'Table of Contents\n\nItem 2.Properties\n\nWe have leased principal properties in both Los Gatos, California, which is the location of our corporate headquarters, and in Los Angeles, California.

The increase in average monthly revenue per paying membership resulted from our price changes and favorable fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. Paid net membership additions for the year ended December\xa031, 2021 decreased 50% as compared to the year ended December\xa031, 2020. Our service continues to grow globally, with over 90% of the paid net membership additions for the year ended December\xa031, 2021 coming from outside the United States and Canada (UCAN) region.\n\nThe increase in operating margin is due primarily to content amortization growing at a slower rate as compared to the 19% increase in revenues in part as a result of delays in content releases due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nThe full extent of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, operations and financial results will depend on numerous evolving factors that we may not be able to accurately predict. See Item 1A: "Risk Factors" section set forth in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional details. While most of our productions have resumed, certain of our productions continue to experience disruption, as do the productions of our third-party content suppliers. Other partners have similarly had their operations disrupted, including those partners that we use for our operations as well as development, production and post-production of content. Production disruptions and new health and safety protocols and requirements can result in additional costs including additional pay to cast and crew and use of PPE and testing. We will continue to actively monitor the issues raised by the COVID-19 pandemic and may take further actions that alter our business operations as may be required by federal, state, local or foreign authorities, or that we determine are in the best interests of our employees, customers, partners and stockholders.\xa0 It is not clear what the potential effects any such alterations or modifications may have on our business, including the effects on our members, suppliers or vendors, or on our financial results.\n\nStreaming Revenues\n\nWe derive revenues from monthly membership fees for services related to streaming content to our members.

following sign-up and a method of payment being provided, and that is not part of a free trial or certain other promotions that may be offered by the Company to new or rejoining members. A membership is canceled and ceases to be reflected in the above metrics as of the effective cancellation date. Voluntary cancellations generally become effective at the end of the prepaid membership period. Involuntary cancellations, as a result of a failed method of payment, become effective immediately. Memberships are assigned to territories based on the geographic location used at time of sign-up as determined by the Company’s internal systems, which utilize industry standard geo-location technology.\n\n(2) We believe constant currency information is useful in analyzing the underlying trends in average monthly revenue per paying membership. In order to exclude the effect of foreign currency rate fluctuations on average monthly revenue per paying membership, we estimate current period revenue assuming foreign exchange rates had remained constant with foreign exchange rates from each of the corresponding months of the prior-year period. For the year ended December\xa031, 2021, our revenues would have been approximately $443\xa0million lower had foreign currency exchange rates remained constant with those for the year ended December\xa031, 2020.\n\nCost of Revenues\n\nAmortization of content assets makes up the majority of cost of revenues. Expenses directly associated with the acquisition, licensing and production of content (such as payroll and related personnel expenses, costs associated with obtaining rights to music included in our content, overall deals with talent, miscellaneous production related costs and participations and residuals), streaming delivery costs and other operations costs make up the remainder of cost of revenues. We have built our own global content delivery network (“Open Connect”) to help us efficiently stream a high volume of content to our members over the internet. Delivery expenses, therefore, include equipment costs related to Open Connect, payroll and related personnel expenses and all third-party costs, such as cloud computing costs, associated with delivering content over the internet. Other operations costs include customer service and payment processing fees, including those we pay to our integrated payment partners, as well as other costs directly incurred in making our content available to members.\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|  | | |  | | | Year Ended December 31, | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |  | | | Change | | | | | | | | |\n|  | | |  | | | 2021 | | |  | | | 2020 | | |  | | | 2019 | | |  | | | 2021 vs. 2020 | | | | | | | | |\n|  | | |  | | | (in\xa0thousands,\xa0except\xa0percentages) | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |\n| Cost of revenues | | |  | | | $ | 17,332,683 |  |  | | | $ | 15,276,319 |  |  | | | $ | 12,440,213 |  |  | | | $ | 2,056,364 |  |  | | | 13 | | % |\n| As a percentage of revenues | | |  | | | 58 | | % |  | | | 61 | | % |  | | | 62 | | % |  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |\n\nThe increase in cost of revenues for the year ended December\xa031, 2021 as compared to the year ended December\xa031, 2020 was primarily due to a $1,423 million increase in content amortization relating to our existing and new content, including more exclusive and original programming. Other costs of revenues increased $633 million, primarily due to the continued growth in our content production activities, coupled with an increase in expenses associated with streaming delivery costs and payment processing fees driven by our growing member base. The decrease in cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues from 61% to 58% is primarily due to delays in content releases due to the COVID-19 pandemic, resulting in content amortization growing at a slower rate as compared to the growth in revenue.\n\nMarketing\n\nMarketing expenses consist primarily of advertising expenses and certain payments made to our marketing partners, including consumer electronics ("CE") manufacturers, MVPDs, mobile operators and ISPs. Advertising expenses include\n\n22', 'Table of Contents\n\npromotional activities such as digital and television advertising.

In addition, personnel-related costs increased $116\xa0million, primarily due to growth in average headcount to support the increase in our production activity and continued improvements in our streaming service.\n\nTechnology and Development\n\nTechnology and development expenses consist primarily of payroll and related expenses for technology personnel responsible for making improvements to our service offerings, including testing, maintaining and modifying our user interface, our recommendations, merchandising and infrastructure.

In addition, third-party expenses, including costs for contractors and consultants, increased $66\xa0million.\n\nInterest Expense\n\nInterest expense consists primarily of the interest associated with our outstanding debt obligations, including the amortization of debt issuance costs.

Interest expense for the year ended December\xa031, 2021 as compared to the year ended December\xa031, 2020 remained flat.\n\nInterest and Other Income (Expense)\n\nInterest and other income (expense) consists primarily of foreign exchange gains and losses on foreign currency denominated balances and interest earned on cash and cash equivalents.\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|  | | |  | | | Year Ended December 31, | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |  | | | Change | | | | | | | | |\n|  | | |  | | | 2021 | | |  | | | 2020 | | |  | | | 2019 | | |  | | | 2021 vs. 2020 | | | | | | | | |\n|  | | |  | | | (in thousands, except percentages) | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |\n| Interest and other income (expense) | | |  | | | $ | 411,214 |  |  | | | $ | (618,441) |  |  | | | $ | 84,000 |  |  | | | $ | 1,029,655 |  |  | | | 166 | | % |\n| As a percentage of revenues | | |  | | | 1 | | % |  | | | (2) | | % |  | | | — | | % |  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |\n\nInterest and other income (expense) increased primarily due to foreign exchange gains of $403 million for the year ended December\xa031, 2021 as compared to a loss of $660\xa0million for the year ended December\xa031, 2020. The foreign exchange gain in the year ended December\xa031, 2021 was primarily driven by the non-cash $431 million gain from the remeasurement of our Senior Notes denominated in euros, partially offset by the remeasurement of cash and content liability positions in currencies other than the functional currencies. The foreign exchange loss in the year ended December\xa031, 2020 was primarily driven by the non-cash $533\xa0million loss from the remeasurement of our Senior Notes denominated in euros, coupled with the remeasurement of cash and content liability positions in currencies other than the functional currencies.\n\nProvision for Income Taxes\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|  | | |  | | | Year Ended December\xa031, | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |  | | | Change | | | | | | | | |\n|  | | |  | | | 2021 | | |  | | | 2020 | | |  | | | 2019 | | |  | | | 2021 vs. 2020 | | | | | | | | |\n|  | | |  | | | (in thousands, except percentages) | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |\n| Provision for income taxes | | |  | | | $ | 723,875 |  |  | | | $ | 437,954 |  |  | | | $ | 195,315 |  |  | | | $ | 285,921 |  |  | | | 65 | | % |\n| Effective tax rate | | |  | | | 12 | | % |  | | | 14 | | % |  | | | 9 | | % |  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |\n\nThe decrease in our effective tax rate for the year ended December\xa031, 2021 as compared to the year ended December\xa031, 2020 is primarily due to the establishment of a valuation allowance on the California R&D credit in the year ended December 31, 2020, offset primarily by a lower benefit on a percentage basis from excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation.\n\nIn 2021, the difference between our 12% effective tax rate and the Federal statutory rate of 21% was primarily due to the recognition of excess tax benefits of stock-based compensation and the impact of international provisions of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.\n\n24', 'Table of Contents\n\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|  | | | Year Ended December\xa031, | | | | | | | | |  | | | Change | | | | | |\n|  | | | 2021 | | |  | | | 2020 | | |  | | | 2021 vs. 2020 | | | | | |\n|  | | | (in thousands) | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |\n| Cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash | | | $ | 6,055,111 |  |  | | | $ | 8,238,870 |  |  | | | $ | (2,183,759) |  | (27) | | % |\n| Short-term and long-term debt | | | 15,392,895 | |  |  | | | 16,308,973 | |  |  | | | (916,078) | |  | (6) | | % |\n\nCash, cash equivalents and restricted cash decreased $2,184 million in the year ended December\xa031, 2021 primarily due to acquisitions, the repurchase of stock, purchases of property and equipment and repayment of debt, partially offset by cash provided by operations.\n\nDebt, net of debt issuance costs, decreased $916 million primarily due to the repayment upon maturity of the $500 million aggregate principal amount of our 5.375% Senior Notes in February 2021, coupled with the remeasurement of our euro-denominated notes. The amount of principal and interest due in the next twelve months is $1,408\xa0million. The amount of principal and interest due beyond the next twelve months is $18,638 million. As of\xa0December\xa031, 2021, no amounts had been borrowed under our $1 billion Revolving Credit Agreement. See Note 6 Debt in the accompanying notes to our consolidated financial statements.\n\nWe anticipate that our future capital needs from the debt market will be more limited compared to prior years. Our ability to obtain this or any additional financing that we may choose to, or need to, obtain will depend on, among other things, our development efforts, business plans, operating performance and the condition of the capital markets at the time we seek financing. We may not be able to obtain such financing on terms acceptable to us or at all. If we raise additional funds through the issuance of equity or debt securities, those securities may have rights, preferences or privileges senior to the rights of our common stock, and our stockholders may experience dilution.\n\nIn March 2021, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $5\xa0billion of our common stock, with no expiration date. Stock repurchases may be effected through open market repurchases in compliance with Rule 10b-18 under the Exchange Act, including through the use of trading plans intended to qualify under Rule 10b5-1 under the Exchange Act, privately-negotiated transactions, accelerated stock repurchase plans, block purchases, or other similar purchase techniques and in such amounts as management deems appropriate. We are not obligated to repurchase any specific number of shares, and the timing and actual number of shares repurchased will depend on a variety of factors, including our stock price, general economic, business and market conditions, and alternative investment opportunities. We may discontinue any repurchases of our common stock at any time without prior notice. As of December\xa031, 2021, the Company has repurchased 1,182,410 shares of common stock for an aggregate amount of $600\xa0million. As of December\xa031, 2021, $4.4\xa0billion remains available for repurchases.\n\nOur primary uses of cash include the acquisition, licensing and production of content, marketing programs, streaming delivery and personnel-related costs. Cash payment terms for non-original content are in line with the amortization period. Investments in original content, and in particular content that we produce and own, require more cash upfront relative to licensed content. For example, production costs are paid as the content is created, well in advance of when the content is available on the service and amortized. We expect to continue to significantly increase our investments in global content, particularly in original content. We currently anticipate that cash flows from operations, available funds and access to financing sources, including our revolving credit facility, will continue to be sufficient to meet our cash needs for the next twelve months and beyond.\n\nOur material cash requirements from known contractual and other obligations primarily relate to our content, debt and lease obligations. Expected timing of those payments are as follows:\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|  | | |  | | | Total | | |  | | | Next 12 Months | | |  | | | Beyond 12 Months | | |\n| Content\xa0obligations\xa0(1) | | |  | | | $ | 23,161,360 |  |  | | | $ | 10,019,306 |  |  | | | $ | 13,142,054 |  |\n| Debt (2) | | |  | | | 20,046,277 | |  |  | | | 1,408,382 | |  |  | | | 18,637,895 | |  |\n| Operating lease obligations (3) | | |  | | | 3,516,461 | |  |  | | | 409,230 | |  |  | | | 3,107,231 | |  |\n| Total | | |  | | | $ | 46,724,098 |  |  | | | $ | 11,836,918 |  |  | | | $ | 34,887,180 |  |\n\n(1)As of December\xa031, 2021, content obligations were comprised of $4.3 billion included in "Current content liabilities" and $3.1 billion of "Non-current content liabilities" on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and $15.8 billion of obligations that are not reflected on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as they did not then meet the criteria for recognition.\n\n25', 'Table of Contents\n\nContent obligations include amounts related to the acquisition, licensing and production of content. An obligation for the production of content includes non-cancelable commitments under creative talent and employment agreements and other production related commitments. An obligation for the acquisition and licensing of content is incurred at the time we enter into an agreement to obtain future titles. Once a title becomes available, a content liability is recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Certain agreements include the obligation to license rights for unknown future titles, the ultimate quantity and/or fees for which are not yet determinable as of the reporting date. Traditional film output deals, or certain TV series license agreements where the number of seasons to be aired is unknown, are examples of these types of agreements. The contractual obligations table above does not include any estimated obligation for the unknown future titles, payment for which could range from less than one year to more than five years. However, these unknown obligations are expected to be significant and we believe could include approximately $1 billion to $4 billion over the next three years, with the payments for the vast majority of such amounts expected to occur after the next twelve months. The foregoing range is based on considerable management judgments and the actual amounts may differ. Once we know the title that we will receive and the license fees, we include the amount in the contractual obligations table above.\n\n(2)Debt obligations include our Notes consisting of principal and interest payments. See Note 6 Debt in the accompanying notes to our consolidated financial statements for further details.\n\n(3)See Note 5 Balance Sheet Components in the accompanying notes to our consolidated financial statements for further details regarding leases. As of December\xa031, 2021, the Company has additional operating leases for real estate that have not yet commenced of $366\xa0million which has been included above. Total lease obligations as of December\xa031, 2021 increased $677\xa0million from $2,839\xa0million as of December\xa031, 2020 to $3,516\xa0million as of December\xa031, 2021 due to growth in facilities to support our growing headcount and growing number of original productions.\n\nIn addition, as of December\xa031, 2021, we had gross unrecognized tax benefits of $203 million, of which $39 million was classified in “Other non-current liabilities" in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. At this time, an estimate of the range of reasonably possible adjustments to the balance of unrecognized tax benefits cannot be made.\n\nFree Cash Flow\n\nWe define free cash flow as cash provided by (used in) operating activities less purchases of property and equipment and change in other assets. We believe free cash flow is an important liquidity metric because it measures, during a given period, the amount of cash generated that is available to repay debt obligations, make strategic acquisitions and investments and for certain other activities like share repurchases. Free cash flow is considered a non-GAAP financial measure and should not be considered in isolation of, or as a substitute for, net income, operating income, cash flow provided by (used in) operating activities, or any other measure of financial performance or liquidity presented in accordance with GAAP.\n\nIn assessing liquidity in relation to our results of operations, we compare free cash flow to net income, noting that the major recurring differences are excess content payments over amortization, non-cash stock-based compensation expense, non-cash remeasurement gain/loss on our euro-denominated debt, and other working capital differences. Working capital differences include deferred revenue, excess property and equipment purchases over depreciation, taxes and semi-annual interest payments on our outstanding debt. Our receivables from members generally settle quickly.\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|  | | | Year Ended December\xa031, | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |  | | | Change | | | | | |\n|  | | | 2021 | | |  | | | 2020 | | |  | | | 2019 | | |  | | | 2021 vs. 2020 | | | | | |\n|  | | | (in thousands) | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |\n| Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities | | | $ | 392,610 |  |  | | | $ | 2,427,077 |  |  | | | $ | (2,887,322) |  |  | | | $ | (2,034,467) |  | (84) | | % |\n| Net cash used in investing activities | | | (1,339,853) | |  |  | | | (505,354) | |  |  | | | (387,064) | |  |  | | | (834,499) | |  | (165) | | % |\n| Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities | | | (1,149,776) | |  |  | | | 1,237,311 | |  |  | | | 4,505,662 | |  |  | | | (2,387,087) | |  | (193) | | % |\n|  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |\n| Non-GAAP reconciliation of free cash flow: | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |\n| Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities | | | 392,610 | |  |  | | | 2,427,077 | |  |  | | | (2,887,322) | |  |  | | | (2,034,467) | |  | (84) | | % |\n| Purchases of property and equipment | | | (524,585) | |  |  | | | (497,923) | |  |  | | | (253,035) | |  |  | | | (26,662) | |  | (5) | | % |\n| Change in other assets | | | (26,919) | |  |  | | | (7,431) | |  |  | | | (134,029) | |  |  | | | (19,488) | |  | (262) | | % |\n| Free cash flow | | | $ | (158,894) |  |  | | | $ | 1,921,723 |  |  | | | $ | (3,274,386) |  |  | | | $ | (2,080,617) |  | (108) | | % |\n\nNet cash provided by operating activities decreased $2,034 million from the year ended December\xa031, 2020 to $393 million for the year ended December\xa031, 2021 primarily driven by an increase in investments in content that require more\n\n26', 'Table of Contents\n\nupfront cash payments, partially offset by a $4,702 million or 19% increase in revenues. The payments for content assets increased $4,933 million, from $12,537 million to $17,469 million, or 39%, as compared to the increase in the amortization of content assets of $1,423 million, from $10,807 million to $12,230 million, or 13%. The increase in payments for content assets was primarily driven by delays in productions resulting from the pandemic that impacted the prior year, which resulted in the timing of certain production payments being shifted into the current year. In addition, we had increased payments associated with higher operating expenses, primarily related to increased headcount to support our continued improvements in our streaming service and our international expansion.\n\nNet cash used in investing activities increased $834 million, primarily due to acquisitions.\n\nNet cash provided by (used in) financing activities decreased $2,387 million primarily due to no debt issuances in the year ended December\xa031, 2021 as compared to proceeds from the issuance of debt of $1,002\xa0million, net of $8\xa0million issuance costs in the year ended December\xa031, 2020, coupled with the repurchases of common stock for an aggregate amount of $600\xa0million in the year ended December\xa031, 2021 and repayment upon maturity of the $500\xa0million aggregate principal amount of our 5.375% Senior Notes in February 2021.\n\nFree cash flow was $5,275 million lower than net income for the year ended December\xa031, 2021 primarily due to $5,239 million of cash payments for content assets over amortization expense, $431\xa0million of non-cash remeasurement gain on our euro-denominated debt and $8\xa0million other non-favorable working capital differences, partially offset by $403\xa0million of non-cash stock-based compensation expenses.\n\nFree cash flow was $840\xa0million lower than net income for the year ended December\xa031, 2020 primarily due to $1,730\xa0million of cash payments for content assets over amortization expense and $308\xa0million in other non-favorable working capital differences, partially offset by $533\xa0million of non-cash remeasurement loss on our euro-denominated debt, $415\xa0million of non-cash stock-based compensation expenses, and a $250\xa0million non-cash valuation allowance on the California R&D credit.\n\nIndemnifications\n\nThe information set forth under Note 8 Guarantees - Indemnification Obligations in the accompanying notes to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8, "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K is incorporated herein by reference.\n\nCritical Accounting Estimates\n\nThe preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported periods. The Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") has defined a company’s critical accounting policies as the ones that are most important to the portrayal of a company’s financial condition and results of operations, and which require a company to make its most difficult and subjective judgments. Based on this definition, we have identified the critical accounting policies and judgments addressed below. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates.\n\nContent\n\nWe acquire, license and produce content, including original programming, in order to offer our members unlimited viewing of video entertainment. The content licenses are for a fixed fee and specific windows of availability. Payment terms for certain content licenses and the production of content require more upfront cash payments relative to the amortization expense. Payments for content, including additions to content assets and the changes in related liabilities, are classified within "Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities" on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.\n\nWe recognize content assets (licensed and produced) as "Content assets, net" on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. For licensed content, we capitalize the fee per title and record a corresponding liability at the gross amount of the liability when the license period begins, the cost of the title is known and the title is accepted and available for streaming. For produced content, we capitalize costs associated with the production, including development cost, direct costs and production overhead. Participations and residuals are expensed in line with the amortization of production costs.\n\nBased on factors including historical and estimated viewing patterns, we amortize the content assets (licensed and produced) in “Cost of revenues” on the Consolidated Statements of Operations over the shorter of each title\'s contractual window of availability or estimated period of use or ten years, beginning with the month of first availability. The amortization is on an accelerated basis, as we typically expect more upfront viewing, and film amortization is more accelerated than TV\n\n27', 'Table of Contents\n\nseries amortization. On average, over 90% of a licensed or produced content asset is expected to be amortized within four years after its month of first availability. We review factors that impact the amortization of the content assets on a regular basis. Our estimates related to these factors require considerable management judgment.\n\nOur business model is subscription based as opposed to a model generating revenues at a specific title level. Content assets (licensed and produced) are predominantly monetized as a group and therefore are reviewed at a group level when an event or change in circumstances indicates a change in the expected usefulness of the content or that the fair value may be less than unamortized cost. To date, we have not identified any such event or changes in circumstances. If such changes are identified in the future, these aggregated content assets will be stated at the lower of unamortized cost or fair value. In addition, unamortized costs for assets that have been, or are expected to be, abandoned are written off.\n\nIncome Taxes\n\nWe record a provision for income taxes for the anticipated tax consequences of our reported results of operations using the asset and liability method. Deferred income taxes are recognized by applying enacted statutory tax rates applicable to future years to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases as well as net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. The measurement of deferred tax assets is reduced, if necessary, by a valuation allowance for any tax benefits for which future realization is uncertain.\n\nAlthough we believe our assumptions, judgments and estimates are reasonable, changes in tax laws or our interpretation of tax laws and the resolution of any tax audits could significantly impact the amounts provided for income taxes in our consolidated financial statements.\n\nIn evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets, in full or in part, we consider all available positive and negative evidence, including our past operating results, and our forecast of future earnings, future taxable income and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies. The assumptions utilized in determining future taxable income require significant judgment and are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying business. Actual operating results in future years could differ from our current assumptions, judgments and estimates. However, we believe that it is more likely than not that most of the deferred tax assets recorded on our Consolidated Balance Sheets will ultimately be realized. We record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the net amount that we believe is more likely than not to be realized. As of December\xa031, 2021 the valuation allowance of $318 million was related to the California research and development credits and certain foreign tax attributes that we do not expect to realize.\n\nWe did not recognize certain tax benefits from uncertain tax positions within the provision for income taxes. We may recognize a tax benefit only if it is more likely than not the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such positions are then measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon settlement. At December\xa031, 2021, our estimated gross unrecognized tax benefits were $203 million of which $136 million, if recognized, would favorably impact our future earnings. Due to uncertainties in any tax audit outcome, our estimates of the ultimate settlement of our unrecognized tax positions may change and the actual tax benefits may differ significantly from the estimates.\n\nSee Note 10 Income Taxes to the consolidated financial statements for further information regarding income taxes.\n\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\n\nThe information set forth under Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements under the caption “Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” is incorporated herein by reference.\n\nItem 7A.Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk\n\nWe are exposed to market risks related to interest rate changes and the corresponding changes in the market values of our debt and foreign currency fluctuations.\n\nInterest Rate Risk\n\nAt December\xa031, 2021, our cash equivalents were generally invested in money market funds. Interest paid on such funds fluctuates with the prevailing interest rate.\n\nAs of December\xa031, 2021, we had $15.5 billion of debt, consisting of fixed rate unsecured debt in fifteen tranches due between 2022 and 2030. Refer to Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements for details about all issuances. The fair value of our debt will fluctuate with movements of interest rates, increasing in periods of declining rates of interest and declining in\n\n28', 'Table of Contents\n\nperiods of increasing rates of interest. The fair value of our debt will also fluctuate based on changes in foreign currency rates, as discussed below.\n\nForeign Currency Risk\n\nRevenues denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar account for 57% of the consolidated amount for the year ended December\xa031, 2021. We therefore have foreign currency risk related to these currencies, which are primarily the euro, the British pound, the Brazilian real, the Canadian dollar, the Mexican peso, the Australian dollar, and the Japanese yen.\n\nAccordingly, changes in exchange rates, and in particular a weakening of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar may negatively affect our revenue and operating income as expressed in U.S. dollars. For the year ended December\xa031, 2021, our revenues would have been approximately $443 million lower had foreign currency exchange rates remained constant with those for the year ended December\xa031, 2020.\n\nWe have also experienced and will continue to experience fluctuations in our net income as a result of gains (losses) on the settlement and the remeasurement of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies that are not the functional currency. In the year ended December\xa031, 2021, we recognized a $403\xa0million foreign exchange gain primarily due to the non-cash remeasurement of our Senior Notes denominated in euros, partially offset by the remeasurement of cash and content liability positions denominated in currencies other than functional currencies.\n\nIn addition, the effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents in the year ended December\xa031, 2021 was an decrease of $87 million.\n\nWe do not use foreign exchange contracts or derivatives to hedge any foreign currency exposures. The volatility of exchange rates depends on many factors that we cannot forecast with reliable accuracy. Our continued international expansion increases our exposure to exchange rate fluctuations and as a result such fluctuations could have a significant impact on our future results of operations.\n\nItem 8.Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\n\nThe consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes listed in Part IV, Item\xa015(a)(1) of this Annual Report on Form 10-K are included immediately following Part IV hereof and incorporated by reference herein.\n\nItem 9.Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure\n\nNone.\n\n29', 'Table of Contents\n\nItem 9A.Controls and Procedures\n\n(a)Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\n\nOur management, with the participation of our co-Chief Executive Officers and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Based on that evaluation, our co-Chief Executive Officers and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K were effective in providing reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission’s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our co-Chief Executive Officers and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures.\n\nOur management, including our co-Chief Executive Officers and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal controls will prevent all error and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within Netflix have been detected.\n\n(b)Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\n\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) of the Exchange Act.) Our management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December\xa031, 2021. In making this assessment, our management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (“COSO”) in Internal Control—Integrated Framework (2013 framework). Based on our assessment under the framework in Internal Control—Integrated Framework (2013 framework), our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December\xa031, 2021. The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December\xa031, 2021 has been audited by Ernst & Young LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report that is included herein.\n\n(c)Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\n\nThere was no change in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended December\xa031, 2021 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\n\n30', 'Table of Contents\n\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\n\nTo the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of Netflix, Inc.\n\nOpinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\n\nWe have audited Netflix, Inc.’s internal control over financial reporting as of December\xa031, 2021, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). In our opinion, Netflix, Inc. (the Company) maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December\xa031, 2021, based on the COSO criteria.\n\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of December\xa031, 2021 and 2020, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, stockholders’ equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December\xa031, 2021, and the related notes and our report dated January\xa027, 2022 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.\n\nBasis for Opinion\n\nThe Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\n\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.\n\nOur audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\n\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\n\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\n\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|  | | | /s/ Ernst & Young LLP | | |\n| San Jose, California | | |  | | |\n| January 27, 2022 | | |  | | |\n\n31', 'Table of Contents\n\nItem 9B.Other Information\n\nNone.\n\nItem 9C.Disclosure Regarding Foreign Jurisdictions that Prevent Inspections\n\nNot applicable.\n\n32', 'Table of Contents\n\nPART III\n\nItem 10.Directors, Executive Officers and Corporate Governance\n\nInformation regarding our directors and executive officers is incorporated by reference from the information contained under the sections “Proposal One: Election of Directors,” “Delinquent Section 16(a) Reports” and “Code of Ethics” in our Proxy Statement for the Annual Meeting of Stockholders.\n\nItem 11.Executive Compensation\n\nInformation required by this item is incorporated by reference from information contained under the section “Compensation of Executive Officers and Other Matters” in our Proxy Statement for the Annual Meeting of Stockholders.\n\nItem 12.Security Ownership of Certain Beneficial Owners and Management and Related Stockholder Matters\n\nInformation required by this item is incorporated by reference from information contained under the sections “Security Ownership of Certain Beneficial Owners and Management” and “Equity Compensation Plan Information” in our Proxy Statement for the Annual Meeting of Stockholders.\n\nItem 13.Certain Relationships and Related Transactions, and Director Independence\n\nInformation required by this item is incorporated by reference from information contained under the section “Certain Relationships and Related Transactions” and “Director Independence” in our Proxy Statement for the Annual Meeting of Stockholders.\n\nItem 14.Principal Accounting Fees and Services\n\nInformation with respect to principal independent registered public accounting firm fees and services is incorporated by reference from the information under the caption “Proposal Two: Ratification of Appointment of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm” in our Proxy Statement for the Annual Meeting of Stockholders.\n\n33', 'Table of Contents\n\nPART IV\n\nItem 15.Exhibits, Financial Statement Schedules\n\n(a)The following documents are filed as part of this Annual Report on Form 10-K:\n\n(1)Financial Statements:\n\nThe financial statements are filed as part of this Annual Report on Form 10-K under “Item 8.

We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\n\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\n\nCritical Audit Matter\n\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective or complex judgments. The communication of the critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\n\n37', "Table of Contents\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|  | | | Content Amortization | | |\n| Description of the Matter | | | As disclosed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements “Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies”, the Company acquires, licenses and produces content, including original programming (“Content”). The Company amortizes Content based on factors including historical and estimated viewing patterns.  Auditing the amortization of the Company’s Content is complex and subjective due to the judgmental nature of amortization which is based on an estimate of future viewing patterns. Estimated viewing patterns are based on historical and forecasted viewing. If actual viewing patterns differ from these estimates, the pattern and/or period of amortization would be changed and could affect the timing of recognition of content amortization. | | |\n|  | | |  | | |\n| How We Addressed the  Matter in Our Audit | | | We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over the content amortization process. For example, we tested controls over management’s review of the content amortization method and the significant assumptions, including the historical and forecasted viewing hour consumption, used to develop estimated viewing patterns. We also tested management’s controls to determine that the data used in the model was complete and accurate.  To test content amortization, our audit procedures included, among others, evaluating the content amortization method, testing the significant assumptions used to develop the estimated viewing patterns and testing the completeness and accuracy of the underlying data. For example, we assessed management’s assumptions by comparing them to current viewing trends and current operating information including comparing previous estimates of viewing patterns to actual results. We also performed sensitivity analyses to evaluate the potential changes in the content amortization recorded that could result from changes in the assumptions. | | |\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- |

consolidated financial statements.\n\n43', 'Table of Contents\n\nNETFLIX, INC.\n\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\n1.Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\n\nDescription of Business\n\nNetflix, Inc. (the “Company”) was incorporated on August\xa029, 1997 and began operations on April\xa014, 1998. The Company is one of the world’s leading entertainment services with approximately 222 million paid memberships in over 190 countries enjoying TV series, documentaries, feature films and mobile games across a wide variety of genres and languages. Members can engage as much as they want, anytime, anywhere, on any internet-connected screen. Members can play, pause and resume watching, all without commercials. Additionally, the Company continues to offer its DVD-by-mail service in the United States ("U.S.").\n\nBasis of Presentation\n\nThe consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. Intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated.\n\nUse of Estimates\n\nThe preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Significant items subject to such estimates and assumptions include the content asset amortization policy and the recognition and measurement of income tax assets and liabilities. The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that the Company believes to be reasonable under the circumstances. On an ongoing basis, the Company evaluates these assumptions, judgments and estimates. Actual results may differ from these estimates.\n\nRecently adopted accounting pronouncements\n\nIn December 2019, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2019-12, Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes (Topic 740). ASU 2019-12 removes certain exceptions for performing intraperiod tax allocations, recognizing deferred taxes for investments, and calculating income taxes in interim periods. The guidance also simplifies the accounting for franchise taxes, transactions that result in a step-up in the tax basis of goodwill, and the effect of enacted changes in tax laws or rates in interim periods. The Company adopted ASU 2019-12 in the first quarter of 2021 and the adoption had no material impact to the Company’s consolidated financial statements.\n\nRecently issued accounting pronouncements not yet adopted\n\nIn October 2021, the FASB issued ASU 2021-08, Business Combinations (Topic 805): Accounting for Contract Assets and Contract Liabilities from Contracts with Customers, which requires an acquirer in a business combination to recognize and measure contract assets and contract liabilities in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification Topic 606. ASU 2021-08 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022 and early adoption is permitted. While the Company is continuing to assess the timing of adoption and the potential impacts of ASU 2021-08, it does not expect ASU 2021-08 to have a material effect, if any, on its consolidated financial statements.\n\nCash Equivalents\n\nThe Company considers investments in instruments purchased with an original maturity of 90 days or less to be cash equivalents. The Company also classifies amounts in transit from payment processors for customer credit card and debit card transactions as cash equivalents.\n\nContent\n\nThe Company acquires, licenses and produces content, including original programming, in order to offer members unlimited viewing of video entertainment. The content licenses are for a fixed fee and specific windows of availability. Payment terms for certain content licenses and the production of content require more upfront cash payments relative to the amortization expense. Payments for content, including additions to content assets and the changes in related liabilities, are classified within "Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities" on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.\n\n44', 'Table of Contents\n\nThe Company recognizes content assets (licensed and produced) as “Content assets, net” on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. For licensed content, the Company capitalizes the fee per title and records a corresponding liability at the gross amount of the liability when the license period begins, the cost of the title is known and the title is accepted and available for streaming. For produced content, the Company capitalizes costs associated with the production, including development costs, direct costs and production overhead. Participations and residuals are expensed in line with the amortization of production costs.\n\nBased on factors including historical and estimated viewing patterns, the Company amortizes the content assets (licensed and produced) in “Cost of revenues” on the Consolidated Statements of Operations over the shorter of each title\'s contractual window of availability or estimated period of use or ten years, beginning with the month of first availability. The amortization is on an accelerated basis, as the Company typically expects more upfront viewing, and film amortization is more accelerated than TV series amortization. On average, over 90% of a licensed or produced content asset is expected to be amortized within four years after its month of first availability. The Company reviews factors impacting the amortization of the content assets on an ongoing basis. The Company\'s estimates related to these factors require considerable management judgment.\n\nThe Company\'s business model is subscription based as opposed to a model generating revenues at a specific title level. Content assets (licensed and produced) are predominantly monetized as a group and therefore are reviewed in aggregate at a group level when an event or change in circumstances indicates a change in the expected usefulness of the content or that the fair value may be less than unamortized cost. To date, the Company has not identified any such event or changes in circumstances. If such changes are identified in the future, these aggregated content assets will be stated at the lower of unamortized cost or fair value. In addition, unamortized costs for assets that have been, or are expected to be, abandoned are written off.\n\nAcquisitions\n\nThe Company uses its best estimates and assumptions to assign fair value to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date. In addition, uncertain tax positions, tax-related valuation allowances and pre-acquisition contingencies are initially recorded in connection with a business combination as of the acquisition date. Intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives.\n\nProperty and Equipment\n\nProperty and equipment are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method over the shorter of the estimated useful lives of the respective assets, generally up to 30 years, or the expected lease term for leasehold improvements, if applicable.\n\nTrade Receivables\n\nTrade receivables consist primarily of amounts related to members and payment partners that collect membership fees on the Company\'s behalf. The Company evaluates the need for an allowance for credit losses based on historical collection trends, the financial condition of its payment partners, and external market factors. The Company\'s allowance for credit losses was not material as of December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020.\n\nMarketing\n\nMarketing expenses consist primarily of advertising expenses and certain payments made to the Company’s partners, including consumer electronics ("CE") manufacturers, multichannel video programming distributors ("MVPDs"), mobile operators and internet service providers ("ISPs"). Advertising expenses include promotional activities such as digital and television advertising. Advertising costs are expensed as incurred. Advertising expenses were $1,669 million, $1,447 million and $1,879 million for the years ended December\xa031, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Marketing expenses also include payroll and related expenses for personnel that support the Company\'s marketing activities.\n\nIncome Taxes\n\nThe Company records a provision for income taxes for the anticipated tax consequences of the reported results of operations using the asset and liability method. Deferred income taxes are recognized by applying enacted statutory tax rates applicable to future years to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases as well as net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. The measurement of deferred tax assets is reduced, if necessary, by a valuation allowance for any tax benefits for which future realization is uncertain.\n\n45', 'Table of Contents\n\nThe Company did not recognize certain tax benefits from uncertain tax positions within the provision for income taxes. The Company may recognize a tax benefit only if it is more likely than not the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such positions are then measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon settlement. The Company recognizes interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions in income tax expense. See Note 10 Income Taxes to the consolidated financial statements for further information regarding income taxes.\n\nForeign Currency\n\nThe functional currency for the Company\'s subsidiaries is determined based on the primary economic environment in which the subsidiary operates. The Company translates the assets and liabilities of its non-U.S. dollar functional currency subsidiaries into U.S. dollars using exchange rates in effect at the end of each period. Revenues and expenses for these subsidiaries are translated using rates that approximate those in effect during the period. Gains and losses from these translations are recognized in cumulative translation adjustment included in "Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)" in Stockholders’ equity on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\n\nThe Company remeasures monetary assets and liabilities that are not denominated in the functional currency at exchange rates in effect at the end of each period. Gains and losses from these remeasurements are recognized in interest and other income (expense). Foreign currency transactions resulted in a gain of $403 million, a loss of $660\xa0million, and a gain of $7\xa0million for the years ended December\xa031, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. These gains and losses were primarily due to the non-cash remeasurement of our Senior Notes denominated in euros and the remeasurement of cash and content liability positions denominated in currencies other than functional currencies.\n\nStock-Based Compensation\n\nThe Company grants fully vested non-qualified stock options to its employees on a monthly basis. As a result of immediate vesting, stock-based compensation expense is fully recognized on the grant date, and no estimate is required for post-vesting option forfeitures. See Note 9 Stockholders\' Equity to the consolidated financial statements for further information regarding stock-based compensation.\n\n2.Revenue Recognition\n\nThe Company\'s primary source of revenues is from monthly membership fees. Members are billed in advance of the start of their monthly membership and revenues are recognized ratably over each monthly membership period. Revenues are presented net of the taxes that are collected from members and remitted to governmental authorities. The Company is the principal in all its relationships where partners, including CE manufacturers, MVPDs, mobile operators and ISPs, provide access to the service as the Company retains control over service delivery to its members. Typically, payments made to the partners, such as for marketing, are expensed. However, if there is no distinct service provided in exchange for the payments made to the partners or if the price that the member pays is established by the partners and there is no standalone price for the Netflix service (for instance, in a bundle), these payments are recognized as a reduction of revenues.\n\nThe following tables summarize streaming revenues, paid net membership additions, and ending paid memberships by region for the years December\xa031, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively:\n\nUnited States and Canada (UCAN)\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|  | | |  | | | As of/ Year Ended December 31, | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |\n|  | | |  | | | 2021 | | |  | | | 2020 | | |  | | | 2019 | | |\n|  | | |  | | | (in thousands) | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |\n| Revenues | | |  | | | $ | 12,972,100 |  |  | | | $ | 11,455,396 |  |  | | | $ | 10,051,208 |  |\n| Paid net membership additions | | |  | | | 1,279 | |  |  | | | 6,274 | |  |  | | | 2,905 | |  |\n| Paid memberships at end of period | | |  | | | 75,215 | |  |  | | | 73,936 | |  |  | | | 67,662 | |  |\n|  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |\n|  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |\n\n46', 'Table of Contents\n\nEurope, Middle East, and Africa (EMEA)\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|  | | |  | | | As of/ Year Ended December 31, | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |\n|  | | |  | | | 2021 | | |  | | | 2020 | | |  | | | 2019 | | |\n|  | | |  | | | (in thousands) | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |\n| Revenues | | |  | | | $ | 9,699,819 |  |  | | | $ | 7,772,252 |  |  | | | $ | 5,543,067 |  |\n| Paid net membership additions | | |  | | | 7,338 | |  |  | | | 14,920 | |  |  | | | 13,960 | |  |\n| Paid memberships at end of period | | |  | | | 74,036 | |  |  | | | 66,698 | |  |  | | | 51,778 | |  |\n|  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |\n|  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |\n\nLatin America (LATAM)\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|  | | |  | | | As of/ Year Ended December 31, | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |\n|  | | |  | | | 2021 | | |  | | | 2020 | | |  | | | 2019 | | |\n|  | | |  | | | (in thousands) | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |\n| Revenues | | |  | | | $ | 3,576,976 |  |  | | | $ | 3,156,727 |  |  | | | $ | 2,795,434 |  |\n| Paid net membership additions | | |  | | | 2,424 | |  |  | | | 6,120 | |  |  | | | 5,340 | |  |\n| Paid memberships at end of period | | |  | | | 39,961 | |  |  | | | 37,537 | |  |  | | | 31,417 | |  |\n|  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |\n|  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |\n\nAsia-Pacific (APAC)\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|  | | |  | | | As of/ Year Ended December 31, | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |\n|  | | |  | | | 2021 | | |  | | | 2020 | | |  | | | 2019 | | |\n|  | | |  | | | (in thousands) | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |\n| Revenues | | |  | | | $ | 3,266,601 |  |  | | | $ | 2,372,300 |  |  | | | $ | 1,469,521 |  |\n| Paid net membership additions | | |  | | | 7,140 | |  |  | | | 9,259 | |  |  | | | 5,626 | |  |\n| Paid memberships at end of period | | |  | | | 32,632 | |  |  | | | 25,492 | |  |  | | | 16,233 | |  |\n|  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |\n|  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |\n\n|  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|  |  |  |\n| A paid membership (also referred to as a paid subscription) is defined as a membership that has the right to receive Netflix service following sign-up and a method of payment being provided, and that is not part of a free trial or certain other promotions that may be offered by the Company to new or rejoining members. A membership is canceled and ceases to be reflected in the above metrics as of the effective cancellation date. Voluntary cancellations generally become effective at the end of the prepaid membership period. Involuntary cancellations, as a result of a failed method of payment, become effective immediately. Memberships are assigned to territories based on the geographic location used at time of sign-up as determined by the Company’s internal systems, which utilize industry standard geo-location technology. | | |\n\nTotal U.S. revenues, inclusive of DVD revenues not reported in the tables above, were $12.1\xa0billion, $10.8\xa0billion and $9.5\xa0billion for the years ended December\xa031, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. DVD revenues were $0.2\xa0billion, $0.2\xa0billion, and $0.3\xa0billion for the years ended December\xa031, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\n\nDeferred revenue consists of membership fees billed that have not been recognized, as well as gift and other prepaid memberships that have not been fully redeemed. As of December 31, 2021, total deferred revenue was $1,209\xa0million, the vast majority of which was related to membership fees billed that are expected to be recognized as revenue within the next month. The remaining deferred revenue balance, which is related to gift cards and other prepaid memberships, will be recognized as revenue over the period of service after redemption, which is expected to occur over the next 12 months. The $91 million increase in deferred revenue as compared to the balance of $1,118\xa0million for the year ended December\xa031, 2020, is a result of the increase in membership fees billed due to increased memberships and average monthly revenue per paying member.\n\n47', "Table of Contents\n\n3.Earnings per Share\n\nBasic earnings per share is computed using the weighted-average number of outstanding shares of common stock during the period. Diluted earnings per share is computed using the weighted-average number of outstanding shares of common stock and, when dilutive, potential common shares outstanding during the period. Potential common shares consist of incremental shares issuable upon the assumed exercise of stock options.

These leases generally have terms which range from 1 year to 15 years, and often include one or more options to renew. These renewal terms can extend the lease term from 1 year to 20 years, and are included in the lease term when it is reasonably certain that the Company will exercise the option. These operating leases are included in "Other non-current assets" on the Company\'s Consolidated Balance Sheets, and represent the Company’s right to use the underlying asset for the lease term. The Company’s obligations to make lease payments are included in "Accrued expenses and other liabilities" and "Other non-current liabilities" on the Company\'s Consolidated Balance Sheets. \xa0Operating lease right-of-use assets and liabilities are recognized at the commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. The Company has entered into various short-term operating leases with an initial term of twelve months or less. These leases are not recorded on the Company\'s Consolidated Balance Sheets. All operating lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Because the rate implicit in each lease is not readily determinable, the Company uses its incremental borrowing rate to determine the present value of the lease payments. The Company has certain contracts for real estate which may contain lease and non-lease components which it has elected to treat as a single lease component.\n\nThe components of lease costs for the years ended December\xa031, 2021, 2020 and 2019 were as follows:\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|  | | | Year ended December 31, | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |\n|  | | | 2021 | | |  | | | 2020 | | |  | | | 2019 | | |\n|  | | | (in thousands) | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |\n| Operating lease cost | | | $ | 389,805 |  |  | | | $ | 323,905 |  |  | | | $ | 218,142 |  |\n| Short-term lease cost | | | 152,765 | |  |  | | | 116,606 | |  |  | | | 229,747 | |  |\n| Total lease cost | | | $ | 542,570 |  |  | | | $ | 440,511 |  |  | | | $ | 447,889 |  |\n\n50', "Table of Contents\n\nInformation related to the Company's operating right-of-use assets and related operating lease liabilities were as follows:\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|  | | | Year ended December 31, | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |\n|  | | | 2021 | | |  | | | 2020 | | |  | | | 2019 | | |\n|  | | | (in thousands) | | | | | | | | |  | | |  | | |\n| Cash paid for operating lease liabilities | | | $ | 349,586 |  |  | | | $ | 259,559 |  |  | | | $ | 192,084 |  |\n| Right-of-use assets obtained in exchange for new operating lease obligations (1) | | | 764,142 | |  |  | | | 729,942 | |  |  | | | 1,672,462 | |  |\n\n(1) Balance as of December\xa031, 2019 includes $743\xa0million for operating leases existing on January 1, 2019.\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|  | | | As of December 31, | | | | | | | | |\n|  | | | 2021 | | |  | | | 2020 | | |\n|  | | | (in thousands, except lease term and discount rate) | | | | | | | | |\n| Operating lease right-of-use assets, net | | | $ | 2,446,573 |  |  | | | $ | 2,037,726 |  |\n|  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |\n| Current operating lease liabilities | | | $ | 315,189 |  |  | | | $ | 256,222 |  |\n| Non-current operating lease liabilities | | | 2,408,486 | |  |  | | | 1,945,631 | |  |\n| Total operating lease liabilities | | | $ | 2,723,675 |  |  | | | $ | 2,201,853 |  |\n|  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |\n| Weighted-average remaining lease term | | | 9.2 years | | |  | | | 8.9 years | | |\n| Weighted-average discount rate | | | 3.1 | | % |  | | | 3.6 | | % |\n\nMaturities of operating lease liabilities as of December\xa031, 2021 were as follows (in thousands):\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| Due in 12 month period ended December 31, | | | | | |\n| 2022 | | | $ | 395,932 |  |\n| 2023 | | | 378,774 | |  |\n| 2024 | | | 358,442 | |  |\n| 2025 | | | 340,028 | |  |\n| 2026 | | | 335,151 | |  |\n| Thereafter | | | 1,332,662 | |  |\n|  | | | 3,140,989 | |  |\n| Less imputed interest | | | (417,314) | |  |\n| Total operating lease liabilities | | | 2,723,675 | |  |\n\nThe Company has additional operating leases for real estate of $366 million which have not commenced as of December\xa031, 2021, and as such, have not been recognized on the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets.

A portion of the outstanding Notes is denominated in foreign currency (comprised of €5,170 million) and is remeasured into U.S. dollars at each balance sheet date (with remeasurement gain totaling $431 million for the year ended December\xa031, 2021).\n\nThe following table provides a summary of the Company\'s outstanding debt and the fair values based on quoted market prices in less active markets as of December\xa031, 2021 and December\xa031, 2020:\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|  | | | Principal Amount at Par | | | | | | | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | | Level 2 Fair Value as of | | | | | | | | |\n|  | | | December 31, 2021 | | |  | | | December 31, 2020 | | |  | | | Issuance Date | | |  | | | Maturity | | |  | | | December 31, 2021 | | |  | | | December 31, 2020 | | |\n|  | | | (in millions) | | | | | | | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | | (in millions) | | | | | | | | |\n| 5.375% Senior Notes | | | $ | — |  |  | | | $ | 500 |  |  | | | February 2013 | | |  | | | February 2021 | | |  | | | $ | — |  |  | | | $ | 502 |  |\n| 5.500% Senior Notes | | | 700 | |  |  | | | 700 | |  |  | | | February 2015 | | |  | | | February 2022 | | |  | | | 704 | |  |  | | | 735 | |  |\n| 5.750% Senior Notes | | | 400 | |  |  | | | 400 | |  |  | | | February 2014 | | |  | | | March 2024 | | |  | | | 437 | |  |  | | | 449 | |  |\n| 5.875% Senior Notes | | | 800 | |  |  | | | 800 | |  |  | | | February 2015 | | |  | | | February 2025 | | |  | | | 899 | |  |  | | | 921 | |  |\n| 3.000% Senior Notes (1) | | | 535 | |  |  | | | 574 | |  |  | | | April 2020 | | |  | | | June 2025 | | |  | | | 581 | |  |  | | | 616 | |  |\n| 3.625% Senior Notes | | | 500 | |  |  | | | 500 | |  |  | | | April 2020 | | |  | | | June 2025 | | |  | | | 529 | |  |  | | | 535 | |  |\n| 4.375% Senior Notes | | | 1,000 | |  |  | | | 1,000 | |  |  | | | October 2016 | | |  | | | November 2026 | | |  | | | 1,111 | |  |  | | | 1,110 | |  |\n| 3.625% Senior Notes (1) | | | 1,480 | |  |  | | | 1,588 | |  |  | | | May 2017 | | |  | | | May 2027 | | |  | | | 1,702 | |  |  | | | 1,776 | |  |\n| 4.875% Senior Notes | | | 1,600 | |  |  | | | 1,600 | |  |  | | | October 2017 | | |  | | | April 2028 | | |  | | | 1,829 | |  |  | | | 1,807 | |  |\n| 5.875% Senior Notes | | | 1,900 | |  |  | | | 1,900 | |  |  | | | April 2018 | | |  | | | November 2028 | | |  | | | 2,293 | |  |  | | | 2,280 | |  |\n| 4.625% Senior Notes (1) | | | 1,252 | |  |  | | | 1,344 | |  |  | | | October 2018 | | |  | | | May 2029 | | |  | | | 1,565 | |  |  | | | 1,630 | |  |\n| 6.375% Senior Notes | | | 800 | |  |  | | | 800 | |  |  | | | October 2018 | | |  | | | May 2029 | | |  | | | 999 | |  |  | | | 995 | |  |\n| 3.875% Senior Notes (1) | | | 1,366 | |  |  | | | 1,466 | |  |  | | | April 2019 | | |  | | | November 2029 | | |  | | | 1,651 | |  |  | | | 1,700 | |  |\n| 5.375% Senior Notes | | | 900 | |  |  | | | 900 | |  |  | | | April 2019 | | |  | | | November 2029 | | |  | | | 1,068 | |  |  | | | 1,061 | |  |\n| 3.625% Senior Notes (1) | | | 1,252 | |  |  | | | 1,344 | |  |  | | | October 2019 | | |  | | | June 2030 | | |  | | | 1,493 | |  |  | | | 1,533 | |  |\n| 4.875% Senior Notes | | | 1,000 | |  |  | | | 1,000 | |  |  | | | October 2019 | | |  | | | June 2030 | | |  | | | 1,169 | |  |  | | | 1,155 | |  |\n|  | | | $ | 15,485 |  |  | | | $ | 16,416 |  |  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | | $ | 18,030 |  |  | | | $ | 18,805 |  |\n|  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |\n|  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |\n|  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |\n\n(1) The following Senior Notes have a principal amount denominated in euro: 3.000% Senior Notes for €470\xa0million, 3.625% Senior Notes for €1,300\xa0million, 4.625% Senior Notes for €1,100\xa0million, 3.875% Senior Notes for €1,200\xa0million, and 3.625% Senior Notes for €1,100\xa0million.\n\nEach of the Notes are repayable in whole or in part upon the occurrence of a change of control, at the option of the holders, at a purchase price in cash equal to 101% of the principal plus accrued interest. The Company may redeem the Notes prior to maturity in whole or in part at an amount equal to the principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest and an applicable premium. The Notes include, among other terms and conditions, limitations on the Company\'s ability to create, incur or allow certain liens; enter into sale and lease-back transactions; create, assume, incur or guarantee additional indebtedness of certain of the Company\'s subsidiaries; and consolidate or merge with, or convey, transfer or lease all or substantially all of the Company\'s and its subsidiaries assets, to another person. As of December\xa031, 2021 and December\xa031, 2020, the Company was in compliance with all related covenants.\n\nRevolving Credit\xa0Facility\n\nOn June 17, 2021, the Company amended its unsecured revolving credit facility ("Revolving Credit Agreement") to, among other things, extend the maturity date from March 29, 2024 to June 17, 2026 and to increase the size of the facility from\n\n53', 'Table of Contents\n\n$750\xa0million to $1\xa0billion. Revolving loans may be borrowed, repaid and reborrowed until June 17, 2026, at which time all amounts borrowed must be repaid. The Company may use the proceeds of future borrowings under the Revolving Credit Agreement for working capital and general corporate purposes. As of\xa0December\xa031, 2021, no amounts have been borrowed under the Revolving Credit Agreement.\n\nThe borrowings under the Revolving Credit Agreement bear interest, at the Company’s option, of either (i) a floating rate equal to a base rate (the “Alternate Base Rate”) or (ii) a rate equal to an adjusted London interbank offered rate (the “Adjusted LIBO Rate”), plus a margin of\xa00.75%. The Alternate Base Rate is defined as the greatest of (A) the rate of interest published by the Wall Street Journal, from time to time, as the prime rate, (B) the federal funds rate, plus\xa00.500%\xa0and (C) the Adjusted LIBO Rate for a one-month interest period, plus\xa01.00%. The Adjusted LIBO Rate is defined as the London interbank offered rate for deposits in U.S. dollars, for the relevant interest period, adjusted for statutory reserve requirements, but in no event shall the Adjusted LIBO Rate be less than\xa00.00%\xa0per annum. Regulatory authorities that oversee financial markets have announced that after the end of 2021, they would no longer compel banks currently reporting information used to set the Adjusted LIBO Rate to continue to make rate submissions, and that publication of the Adjusted LIBO Rate based upon U.S. Dollars is expected to cease on June 30, 2023. The Revolving Credit Agreement contains customary provisions for the replacement of the Adjusted LIBO Rate with an alternate benchmark rate, including a rate based on the secured overnight financing rate published by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, as the Adjusted LIBO Rate is phased out in the lending market. The Company does not anticipate that the replacement of the Adjusted LIBO Rate with such alternative benchmark rate, as provided in the Revolving Credit Agreement, will materially impact its liquidity or financial position.\n\nThe Company is also obligated to pay a commitment fee on the undrawn amounts of the Revolving Credit Agreement at an annual rate of\xa00.10%. The Revolving Credit Agreement requires the Company to comply with certain covenants, including covenants that limit or restrict the ability of the Company’s subsidiaries to incur debt and limit or restrict the ability of the Company and its subsidiaries to grant liens and enter into sale and leaseback transactions; and, in the case of the Company or a guarantor, merge, consolidate, liquidate, dissolve or sell, transfer, lease or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole. As of\xa0December\xa031, 2021 and December\xa031, 2020, the Company was in compliance with all related covenants.\n\n7.Commitments and Contingencies\n\nContent\n\nAt December\xa031, 2021, the Company had $23.2 billion of obligations comprised of $4.3 billion included in "Current content liabilities" and $3.1 billion of "Non-current content liabilities" on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and $15.8 billion of obligations that are not reflected on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as they did not yet meet the criteria for asset recognition.\n\nAt December\xa031, 2020, the Company had $19.2 billion of obligations comprised of $4.4 billion included in "Current content liabilities" and $2.6 billion of "Non-current content liabilities" on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and $12.2 billion of obligations that are not reflected on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as they did not yet meet the criteria for asset recognition.\n\nThe expected timing of payments for these content obligations is as follows:\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|  | | | As of December 31, | | | | | | | | |\n|  | | | 2021 | | |  | | | 2020 | | |\n|  | | | (in\xa0thousands) | | | | | | | | |\n| Less than one year | | | $ | 10,019,306 |  |  | | | $ | 8,980,868 |  |\n| Due after one year and through 3 years | | | 9,238,315 | |  |  | | | 7,819,563 | |  |\n| Due after 3 years and through 5 years | | | 3,238,977 | |  |  | | | 1,973,091 | |  |\n| Due after 5 years | | | 664,762 | |  |  | | | 445,308 | |  |\n| Total content obligations | | | $ | 23,161,360 |  |  | | | $ | 19,218,830 |  |\n\nContent obligations include amounts related to the acquisition, licensing and production of content. Obligations that are in non-U.S. dollar currencies are translated to the U.S. dollar at period end rates. An obligation for the production of content includes non-cancelable commitments under creative talent and employment agreements as well as other production related commitments. An obligation for the acquisition and licensing of content is incurred at the time the Company enters into an agreement to obtain future titles. Once a title becomes available, a content liability is recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Certain agreements include the obligation to license rights for unknown future titles, the ultimate quantity and/or fees for which are not yet determinable as of the reporting date. Traditional film output deals, or certain TV series license agreements where the number of seasons to be aired is unknown, are examples of such license agreements. The Company does\n\n54', "Table of Contents\n\nnot include any estimated obligation for these future titles beyond the known minimum amount. However, the unknown obligations are expected to be significant.\n\nLegal Proceedings\n\nFrom time to time, in the normal course of its operations, the Company is subject to litigation matters and claims, including claims relating to employee relations, business practices and patent infringement. Litigation can be expensive and disruptive to normal business operations. Moreover, the results of complex legal proceedings are difficult to predict and the Company's view of these matters may change in the future as the litigation and events related thereto unfold. The Company expenses legal fees as incurred. The Company records a provision for contingent losses when it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. An unfavorable outcome to any legal matter, if material, could have an adverse effect on the Company's operations or its financial position, liquidity or results of operations.\n\nThe Company is involved in litigation matters not listed herein but does not consider the matters to be material either individually or in the aggregate at this time. The Company's view of the matters not listed may change in the future as the litigation and events related thereto unfold.\n\n8.Guarantees—Indemnification Obligations\n\nIn the ordinary course of business, the Company has entered into contractual arrangements under which it has agreed to provide indemnification of varying scope and terms to business partners and other parties with respect to certain matters, including, but not limited to, losses arising out of the Company’s breach of such agreements and out of intellectual property infringement claims made by third parties. In these circumstances, payment may be conditional on the other party making a claim pursuant to the procedures specified in the particular contract.\n\nThe Company’s obligations under these agreements may be limited in terms of time or amount, and in some instances, the Company may have recourse against third parties for certain payments. In addition, the Company has entered into indemnification agreements with its directors and certain of its officers that will require it, among other things, to indemnify them against certain liabilities that may arise by reason of their status or service as directors or officers. The terms of such obligations vary.\n\nIt is not possible to make a reasonable estimate of the maximum potential amount of future payments under these or similar agreements due to the conditional nature of the Company’s obligations and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular agreement. No amount has been accrued in the accompanying consolidated financial statements with respect to these indemnification guarantees.\n\n55", "Table of Contents\n\n9. Stockholders’ Equity\n\nVoting Rights\n\nThe holders of each share of common stock shall be entitled to one vote per share on all matters to be voted upon by the Company’s stockholders.\n\nStock Option Plan\n\nOn June 4, 2020, the Company's stockholders approved the 2020 Stock Plan, which was adopted by the Company's Board of Directors on March 4, 2020 subject to stockholder approval. The 2020 Stock Plan is the successor to the 2011 Stock Plan. The 2020 Stock Plan provides for the grant of incentive stock options to employees and for the grant of non-statutory stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock and restricted stock units to employees, directors and consultants. The 2020 Stock Plan authorized 17,500,000 new shares to be available for award grants. As of the date the 2020 Stock Plan was adopted by the Company's Board of Directors, 5,530,106 shares were available to be granted under the 2011 Stock Plan. These shares are available for award grants under the 2020 Stock Plan.\n\nA summary of the activities related to the Company’s stock option plans is as follows:\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|  | | | Shares\xa0Available for Grant | | |  | | | Options Outstanding | | | | | | | | |\n|  | | | Number of Shares | | |  | | | Weighted- Average Exercise Price  (per Share) | | |\n| Balances as of December 31, 2018 | | | 8,699,941 | |  |  | | | 20,479,278 | |  |  | | | $ | 89.61 |  |\n| Granted | | | (2,588,380) | |  |  | | | 2,588,380 | |  |  | | | 320.66 | |  |\n| Exercised | | | — | |  |  | | | (2,208,052) | |  |  | | | 32.88 | |  |\n| Expired | | | — | |  |  | | | (280) | |  |  | | | 6.74 | |  |\n| Balances as of December 31, 2019 | | | 6,111,561 | |  |  | | | 20,859,326 | |  |  | | | $ | 124.28 |  |\n| New Shares Authorized | | | 17,500,000 | |  |  | | | — | |  |  | | | — | |  |\n| Granted | | | (1,909,476) | |  |  | | | 1,909,476 | |  |  | | | 432.34 | |  |\n| Exercised | | |  | | |  | | | (4,088,612) | |  |  | | | 58.35 | |  |\n| Expired | | | — | |  |  | | | (3,380) | |  |  | | | 27.54 | |  |\n| Balances as of December 31, 2020 | | | 21,702,085 | |  |  | | | 18,676,810 | |  |  | | | $ | 170.23 |  |\n| Granted | | | (1,556,725) | |  |  | | | 1,556,725 | |  |  | | | 554.11 | |  |\n| Exercised | | | — | |  |  | | | (2,632,324) | |  |  | | | 65.97 | |  |\n| Expired | | | — | |  |  | | | (5,360) | |  |  | | | 34.63 | |  |\n| Balances as of December 31, 2021 | | | 20,145,360 | |  |  | | | 17,595,851 | |  |  | | | $ | 219.83 |  |\n| Vested and exercisable at December\xa031, 2021 | | |  | | |  | | | 17,595,851 | |  |  | | | $ | 219.83 |  |\n\nThe aggregate intrinsic value of the Company's outstanding stock options as of December\xa031, 2021 was $6,744\xa0million and represents the total pretax intrinsic value (the difference between the Company’s closing stock price on the last trading day of 2021 and the exercise price, multiplied by the number of in-the-money options) that would have been received by the option holders had all option holders exercised their options on the last trading day of 2021. This amount changes based on the fair market value of the Company’s common stock. Total intrinsic value of options exercised for the years ended December\xa031, 2021, 2020 and 2019 was $1,363 million, $1,596 million and $666 million, respectively. The weighted-average remaining contractual term of the Company's outstanding stock options as of December\xa031, 2021 included in the table above was 5.37 years.\n\nCash received from option exercises for the years ended December\xa031, 2021, 2020 and 2019 was $174 million, $235 million and $72 million, respectively. The Company records stock option exercises based on trade date.\n\n56", 'Table of Contents\n\nStock-Based Compensation\n\nStock options granted are exercisable for the full ten year contractual term regardless of employment status.

The Company believes that implied volatility of publicly traded options in its common stock is more reflective of market conditions, and given consistently high trade volumes of the options, can reasonably be expected to be a better indicator of expected volatility than historical volatility of its common stock.\n\nIn valuing shares issued under the Company’s employee stock option plans, the Company bases the risk-free interest rate on U.S. Treasury zero-coupon issues with terms similar to the contractual term of the options. The Company does not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future and therefore uses an expected dividend yield of\xa0zero\xa0in the option valuation model. The Company does not use a post-vesting termination rate as options are fully vested upon grant date.\n\nStock Repurchases\n\nIn March 2021, the Company’s Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $5\xa0billion of its common stock, with no expiration date. Stock repurchases may be effected through open market repurchases in compliance with Rule 10b-18 under the Exchange Act, including through the use of trading plans intended to qualify under Rule 10b5-1 under the Exchange Act, privately-negotiated transactions, accelerated stock repurchase plans, block purchases, or other similar purchase techniques and in such amounts as management deems appropriate. The Company is not obligated to repurchase any specific number of shares, and the timing and actual number of shares repurchased will depend on a variety of factors, including the Company’s stock price, general economic, business and market conditions, and alternative investment opportunities. The Company may discontinue any repurchases of its common stock at any time without prior notice. During the twelve months ended December 31, 2021, the Company repurchased 1,182,410 shares, for an aggregate amount of $600\xa0million. As of December\xa031, 2021, $4.4\xa0billion remain available for repurchases. Shares repurchased by the Company are accounted for when the transaction is settled. As of December\xa031, 2021, there were no unsettled share repurchases. Direct costs incurred to acquire the shares are included in the total cost of the shares.\n\n10.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Income Taxes\n\nIncome before provision for income taxes was as follows:\n\n|  |  |  |

classified as “Other non-current assets” on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December\xa031, 2021 and December\xa031, 2020. In evaluating its ability to realize the net deferred tax assets, the Company considered all available positive and negative evidence, including its past operating results and the forecast of future market growth, forecasted earnings, future taxable income, and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies. As of December\xa031, 2021, the valuation allowance of $318 million was related to the California R&D credits and certain foreign tax attributes that the Company does not expect to realize.\n\nAs of December\xa031, 2021, the Company\'s Federal R&D tax credit and state tax credit carryforwards for tax return purposes were $274 million, and $456 million, respectively. The Federal R&D tax credit carryforwards expire through 2041. State tax credit carryforwards can be carried forward indefinitely.\n\nThe unrecognized tax benefits that are not expected to result in payment or receipt of cash within one year are classified as “Other non-current liabilities” and a reduction of deferred tax assets which is classified as "Other non-current assets" in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of December\xa031, 2021, the total amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits was $203 million, of which $136 million, if recognized, would favorably impact the Company’s effective tax rate. As of\xa0December\xa031, 2020, the total amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits was $140 million, of which\xa0$86 million, if recognized, would favorably impact the Company’s effective tax rate. The aggregate changes in the Company’s total gross amount of unrecognized tax benefits are summarized as follows (in thousands):\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| Balances as of December 31, 2019 | | | $ | 66,768 |  |\n| Increases related to tax positions taken during prior periods | | | 11,943 | |  |\n| Decreases related to tax positions taken during prior periods | | | (3,697) | |  |\n| Increases related to tax positions taken during the current period | | | 65,110 | |  |\n| Decreases related to expiration of statute of limitations | | | — | |  |\n| Balances as of December 31, 2020 | | | 140,124 | |  |\n| Increases related to tax positions taken during prior periods | | | 27,116 | |  |\n| Decreases related to tax positions taken during prior periods | | | — | |  |\n| Increases related to tax positions taken during the current period | | | 35,317 | |  |\n| Decreases related to expiration of statute of limitations | | | — | |  |\n|  | | |  | | |\n|  | | |  | | |\n| Balances as of December 31, 2021 | | | $ | 202,557 |  |\n\n59', 'Table of Contents\n\nThe Company includes interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits within the provision for income taxes and in “Other non-current liabilities” in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Interest and penalties included in the Company\'s provision for income taxes were not material in all the periods presented.\n\nThe Company files U.S. Federal, state and foreign tax returns. The Company is currently under examination by the IRS for years 2016 through 2018 and is subject to examination for 2019 and 2020. The foreign and state tax returns for years 2015 through 2020 are subject to examination by various states and foreign jurisdictions. While the Company is in various stages of inquiries and examinations for some state and federal taxing authorities, we believe that our tax positions will more likely than not be sustained. Nonetheless, it is possible that future obligations related to these matters could arise.\n\nGiven the potential outcome of the current examinations as well as the impact of the current examinations on the potential expiration of the statute of limitations, it is reasonably possible that the balance of unrecognized tax benefits could significantly change within the next twelve months. However, an estimate of the range of reasonably possible adjustments cannot be made at this time.\n\n11.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Employee Benefit Plan\n\nThe Company maintains a 401(k) savings plan covering substantially all of its employees. Eligible employees may contribute up to 80% of their annual salary through payroll deductions, but not more than the statutory limits set by the Internal Revenue Service. The Company matches employee contributions at the discretion of the Board. During 2021, 2020 and 2019, the Company’s matching contributions totaled $85 million, $69 million and $47 million, respectively.\n\nMultiemployer Benefit Plans\n\nThe Company contributes to various multiemployer defined pension plans under the terms of collective bargaining agreements that cover our union-represented employees. The risks of participating in multiemployer pension plans are different from single-employer plans such that (i) contributions made by the Company to the multiemployer pension plans may be used to provide benefits to employees of other participating employers; (ii) if the Company chooses to stop participating in the multiemployer pension plans, it may be required to pay those plans an amount based on the underfunded status of the plan; and (iii) if the Company stops contributing to the multiemployer pension plan, the unfunded obligations of the plan may become the obligation of the remaining participating employers. The Company also contributes to various other multiemployer benefit plans that provide health and welfare benefits to both active and retired participants. The Company does not participate in any multiemployer benefit plans that are individually significant to the Company.\n\nThe following table summarizes the Company\'s contributions to multiemployer pension and health plans for the years ended December\xa031, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively:\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|  | | | Year Ended December\xa031, | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |\n|  | | | 2021 | | |  | | | 2020 | | |  | | | 2019 | | |\n|  | | | (in thousands) | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |\n| Pension benefits | | | $ | 111,133 |  |  | | | $ | 78,060 |  |  | | | $ | 89,703 |  |\n| Health benefits | | | 83,153 | |  |  | | | 52,322 | |  |  | | | 44,351 | |  |\n| Total contributions | | | $ | 194,286 |  |  | | | $ | 130,382 |  |  | | | $ | 134,054 |  |\n\n12.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Segment and Geographic Information\n\nThe Company operates as one operating segment.

(“Netflix”, “the Company”, “registrant”, “we”, or “us”) is one of the world’s leading entertainment services with approximately 204 million paid memberships in over 190 countries enjoying TV series, documentaries and feature films across a wide variety of genres and languages. Members can watch as much as they want, anytime, anywhere, on any internet-connected screen. Members can play, pause and resume watching, all without commercials. Additionally, we continue to offer our DVD-by-mail service in the United States (“U.S.”).\n\nWe are a pioneer in the delivery of streaming entertainment, launching our streaming service in 2007. Since this launch, we have developed an ecosystem for internet-connected screens and have added increasing amounts of content that enable consumers to enjoy entertainment directly on their internet-connected screens. As a result of these efforts, we have experienced growing consumer acceptance of, and interest in, the delivery of streaming entertainment.\n\nOur core strategy is to grow our streaming membership business globally within the parameters of our operating margin target. We are continuously improving our members\' experience by expanding our content with a focus on a programming mix of content that delights our members and attracts new members. In addition, we are continuously enhancing our user interface and extending our streaming service to more internet-connected screens. Our members can download a selection of titles for offline viewing.\n\nBUSINESS SEGMENTS\n\nWe operate as one operating segment. Our revenues are primarily derived from monthly membership fees for services related to streaming content to our members. See Note 12, Segment and Geographic Information, in the accompanying notes to our consolidated financial statements for further detail.\n\nCOMPETITION\n\nThe market for video entertainment is intensely competitive and subject to rapid change. We compete against other entertainment video providers, such as multichannel video programming distributors (“MVPDs”), streaming entertainment providers (including those that provide pirated content), video gaming providers and more broadly against other sources of entertainment that our members could choose in their moments of free time. We also compete against streaming entertainment providers and content producers in obtaining content for our service, both for licensed content and for original content projects.\n\nWhile consumers may maintain simultaneous relationships with multiple entertainment sources, we strive for consumers to choose us in their moments of free time. We have often referred to this choice as our objective of "winning moments of\n\n1', 'Table of Contents\n\ntruth." In attempting to win these moments of truth with our members, we are continually improving our service, including both our technology and our content, which is increasingly exclusive and curated, and includes our original programming.\n\nSEASONALITY\n\nOur membership growth exhibits a seasonal pattern that reflects variations when consumers buy internet-connected screens and when they tend to increase their viewing. Historically, the first and fourth quarters (October through March) represent our greatest streaming membership growth. In addition, our membership growth can be impacted by our content release schedule and changes to pricing.\n\nINTELLECTUAL PROPERTY\n\nWe regard our trademarks, service marks, copyrights, patents, domain names, trade dress, trade secrets, proprietary technologies and similar intellectual property as important to our success. We use a combination of patent, trademark, copyright and trade secret laws and confidentiality agreements to protect our proprietary intellectual property. Our intellectual property rights extend to our technology, business processes and the content we produce and distribute through our service. We use the intellectual property of third parties in creating some of our content, merchandising our products and marketing our service. Our ability to provide our members with content they can watch depends on studios, content providers and other rights holders licensing rights, including distribution rights, to such content and certain related elements thereof, such as the public performance of music contained within the content we distribute. The license periods and the terms and conditions of such licenses vary. Our ability to protect and enforce our intellectual property rights is subject to certain risks and from time to time we encounter disputes over rights and obligations concerning intellectual property. We cannot provide assurance that we will prevail in any intellectual property disputes.\n\nREGULATION\n\nThe media landscape and the internet delivery of content have seen growing regulatory action. Historically, media has been highly regulated in many countries. We are seeing some of these legacy regulatory frameworks be updated and expanded to address services like ours. In particular, we are seeing some countries update their cultural support legislation to include services like Netflix. This includes content quotas, levies and investment obligations. Some even restrict the extent of ownership rights we can have both in our service and in our content. In certain countries, regulators are also looking at restrictions that could require formal reviews of and/or adjustments to content that appears on our service in their country. In general these regulations impact all services and may make operating in certain jurisdictions more expensive or restrictive as to the content offering we may provide.\n\nHUMAN CAPITAL\n\nWe view our employees and our culture as key to our success. As of December\xa031, 2020, we had approximately 9,400 full-time employees located globally in 59 countries. Of these, 7,600 (81%) were located in the United States and Canada, 1,000 (11%) in Europe, Middle East, and Africa, 200 (2%) in Latin America and 600 (6%) in Asia-Pacific. We also have a number of employees engaged in content production, some of whom are part-time or temporary, and whose numbers fluctuate throughout the year.\n\nWe believe a critical component of our success is our company culture. This culture, which is detailed in a "Culture Memo" located on our website, is often described as a high-performance culture of freedom and responsibility. We aim to attract and retain great people - representing a diverse array of perspectives and skills - to work together as a dream team. We empower all of our employees so that they can have significant impact and input into decision-making; each employee has the freedom and power to make the decisions and take actions in the best interest of the Company in carrying out their role. In return, our employees are responsible and accountable for those decisions and actions. With this approach, we believe we are a more flexible, fun, stimulating, creative, collaborative and successful organization.\n\nAs we have expanded our offices globally, our company culture remains an important aspect of our operations. We have also become mindful of cultural differences across and within regions. Fostering a work environment that is culturally diverse, inclusive and equitable is a major focus for us. We employ a team reporting to our VP of Inclusion Strategy who works to build diversity, inclusion and equity into all aspects of our operations globally, with the goal of having diversity and inclusion function as a critical lens through which each Netflix employee carries out their role. We want more people and cultures to see themselves reflected on screen - so it’s important that our employees are diverse like the communities we serve. Our Inclusion team helps increase representation by training our recruiters on how to hire more inclusively, and to help the company and senior leaders diversify their networks. We also support numerous employee resource groups (ERGs), representing employees and allies from a broad array of historically underrepresented and/or marginalized communities. Our ERGs are important in\n\n2', 'Table of Contents\n\ncreating a more inclusive environment for all employees, allowing space to connect on shared experiences, providing mentoring, career development and volunteering opportunities, and to provide the Company with insight into the perspectives, needs and lived experiences of the communities. Each ERG is supported by senior leaders across the Company. We published our first Inclusion report in January 2021 which further highlights our approach to diversity and inclusion.\n\nWe believe in fostering great leaders. We employ a VP of Leadership Programs, whose team’s mission is to design programs, such as seminars and lectures, that help our leaders (officers, VPs and director-level employees) examine values that guide them personally, and as leaders, especially when those values come into tension with the world around us. The goal of these programs is to create great human beings, who become great leaders, who shape a great company. We also employ a learning and development team that programs workshops to provide skills and coaching to employees on a variety of topics, such as leading and inspiring teams. We believe this focus helps our employees grow as leaders and well-rounded individuals, and better positions Netflix to operate our global business of providing compelling content to entertain the world.\n\nWe aim to pay our employees at the top of their personal market, and they generally are able to choose the form of their compensation between cash and stock options. This permits employee compensation to be highly personalized and reflective of each employee\'s individual needs and preferences. In 2020, we conducted a pay equity analysis and adopted practices to ensure that employees from underrepresented groups are not being underpaid relative to others doing the same or similar work. We also practice “open compensation,” which means the top leaders (director-level and above) at the company can see how much any employee is paid. This encourages open discussions about pay disparities throughout the Company. We aim to rectify any pay gaps that we find through these approaches.\n\nWe care about the health and well-being of our employees and their families. Each employee receives an annual cash health benefit allowance that they may allocate to medical, dental and vision premiums in a way that makes sense for them. If any portion of the benefit is unused, the employee is paid the unused benefit as cash compensation, up to $5,000. Employees have access to a host of other benefits, including mental health, childcare, family planning and a company match for charitable donations. We enhanced a number of these benefits to support our employees through the challenges arising from the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nWe believe that our approach to human capital resources has been instrumental in our growth, and has made Netflix a desirable destination for employees.\n\nOTHER INFORMATION\n\nWe maintain a website at www.netflix.com. The contents of our website are not incorporated in, or otherwise to be regarded as part of, this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We make available, free of charge on our website, access to our Annual Report on Form 10-K, our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, our Current Reports on Form 8-K and amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), as soon as reasonably practicable after we file or furnish them electronically with the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC").\n\nInvestors and others should note that we announce material financial information to our investors using our investor relations website (ir.netflix.net), SEC filings, press releases, public conference calls and webcasts. We use these channels as well as social media and blogs to communicate with our members and the public about our company, our services and other issues. It is possible that the information we post on social media and blogs could be deemed to be material information. Therefore, we encourage investors, the media, and others interested in our company to review the information we post on the social media channels and blogs listed on our investor relations website.\n\n3', 'Table of Contents\n\nItem 1A.Risk Factors\n\nIf any of the following risks actually occur, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be harmed. In that case, the trading price of our common stock could decline, and you could lose all or part of your investment.\n\nRisks Related to Our Business\n\nThe ongoing coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic and the global attempt to contain it may harm our industry, business, results of operations and ability to raise additional capital.\n\nThe global spread of the coronavirus (COVID-19) and the various attempts to contain it have created significant volatility, uncertainty and economic disruption. In an effort to contain COVID-19 or slow its spread, governments around the world have enacted various measures, some of which have been subsequently rescinded, modified or reinstated, including orders to close all businesses not deemed “essential,” isolate residents to their homes or places of residence, and practice social distancing. We anticipate that these actions and the global health crisis caused by COVID-19, including any resurgences, will continue to negatively impact business activity across the globe. In response to government mandates, health care advisories and otherwise responding to employee and vendor concerns, we have altered certain aspects of our operations. In an effort to protect the health and safety of our employees, our workforce has and continues to spend a significant amount of time working from home. International travel has been severely curtailed and many of our productions continue to experience disruption, as are productions of our third-party content suppliers. Other partners have similarly had their operations disrupted, including those partners that we use for our operations as well as development, production and post-production of content. While we and our partners have resumed productions and related operations in many parts of the world, our ability to produce content remains affected by the pandemic. To the extent the resulting economic disruption is severe, we could see some vendors go out of business, resulting in supply constraints and increased costs or delays to our productions. Such production pauses may cause us temporarily to have less new content available on our service in subsequent quarters, which could negatively impact consumer demand for and member retention to our service and the number of paid memberships. Temporary production pauses or permanent shutdowns in production could result in content asset impairments or other charges and will change the timing and amount of cash outflows associated with production activity.\n\nThe full extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic and the various responses to it impacts our business, operations and financial results will depend on numerous evolving factors that we may not be able to accurately predict, including: the duration and scope of the pandemic; governmental, business and individuals’ actions that have been and continue to be taken in response to the pandemic; the availability and cost to access the capital markets; the effect on our customers and customer demand for and ability to pay for our services; disruptions or restrictions on our employees’ ability to work and travel; and any stoppages, disruptions or increased costs associated with our development, production, post-production, marketing and distribution of original programming. During the COVID-19 crisis, we may not be able to provide the same level of customer service and product features that our members are used to which could negatively impact their perception of our service resulting in an increase in cancellations. Furthermore, given increased government expenditures associated with their COVID-19 response, we could see increased government obligations which could negatively impact our results of operations. If we need to access the capital markets, there can be no assurance that financing may be available on attractive terms, if at all. We will continue to actively monitor the issues raised by the COVID-19 pandemic and may take further actions that alter our business operations, including content production, as may be required by federal, state, local or foreign authorities, or that we determine are in the best interests of our employees, customers, partners and stockholders. It is not clear what the potential effects any such alterations or modifications may have on our business, including the effects on our customers, suppliers or vendors, or on our financial results.\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic also led to an increase in our net paid membership additions relative to our quarterly forecast and historic trends in the first half of 2020, and slower net paid membership additions in the second half of 2020 relative to historic trends. These results, as well as those of other metrics such as revenues, operating margins, net income, net cash provided by operating activities and other financial and operating data, may not be indicative of results for future periods. In addition to the potential direct impacts to our business, the global economy is likely to be significantly weakened as a result of the actions taken in response to COVID-19. To the extent that such a weakened global economy impacts consumers’ ability or willingness to pay for our service or vendors’ ability to provide services to us, especially those related to our content productions, we could see our business and results of operation negatively impacted.\n\n4', 'Table of Contents\n\nIf our efforts to attract and retain members are not successful, our business will be adversely affected.\n\nWe have experienced significant membership growth over the past several years. Our ability to continue to attract members will depend in part on our ability to consistently provide our members with compelling content choices, effectively market our service, as well as provide a quality experience for selecting and viewing TV series, documentaries and feature films. Furthermore, the relative service levels, content offerings, pricing and related features of competitors to our service may adversely impact our ability to attract and retain memberships. Competitors include other entertainment video providers, such as MVPDs, and streaming entertainment providers (including those that provide pirated content), as well as video gaming providers and more broadly other sources of entertainment that our members could choose in their moments of free time. If consumers do not perceive our service offering to be of value, including if we introduce new or adjust existing features, adjust pricing or service offerings, or change the mix of content in a manner that is not favorably received by them, we may not be able to attract and retain members. We may, from time to time, adjust our membership pricing or our pricing model itself, which may not be well-received by consumers, and which may result in existing members canceling our service or fewer new members joining our service. In addition, many of our members rejoin our service or originate from word-of-mouth advertising from existing members. If our efforts to satisfy our existing members are not successful, we may not be able to attract members, and as a result, our ability to maintain and/or grow our business will be adversely affected. Members cancel our service for many reasons, including a perception that they do not use the service sufficiently, the need to cut household expenses, availability of content is unsatisfactory, competitive services provide a better value or experience and customer service issues are not satisfactorily resolved. We must continually add new memberships both to replace canceled memberships and to grow our business beyond our current membership base. While we permit multiple users within the same household to share a single account for non-commercial purposes, if multi-household usage is abused or if our efforts to restrict multi-household usage are ineffective, our ability to add new members may be hindered and our results of operations may be adversely impacted. If we do not grow as expected, given, in particular, that our content costs are largely fixed in nature and contracted over several years, we may not be able to adjust our expenditures or increase our (per membership) revenues commensurate with the lowered growth rate such that our margins, liquidity and results of operation may be adversely impacted. If we are unable to successfully compete with current and new competitors in both retaining our existing memberships and attracting new memberships, our business will be adversely affected. Further, if excessive numbers of members cancel our service, we may be required to incur significantly higher marketing expenditures than we currently anticipate to replace these members with new members.\n\nChanges in competitive offerings for entertainment video, including the potential rapid adoption of piracy-based video offerings, could adversely impact our business.\n\nThe market for entertainment video is intensely competitive and subject to rapid change. Through new and existing distribution channels, consumers have increasing options to access entertainment video. The various economic models underlying these channels include subscription, transactional, ad-supported and piracy-based models. All of these have the potential to capture meaningful segments of the entertainment video market. Piracy, in particular, threatens to damage our business, as its fundamental proposition to consumers is so compelling and difficult to compete against: virtually all content for free. Furthermore, in light of the compelling consumer proposition, piracy services are subject to rapid global growth. Traditional providers of entertainment video, including broadcasters and cable network operators, as well as internet based e-commerce or entertainment video providers are increasing their streaming video offerings. Several of these competitors have long operating histories, large customer bases, strong brand recognition, exclusive rights to certain content and significant financial, marketing and other resources. They may secure better terms from suppliers, adopt more aggressive pricing and devote more resources to product development, technology, infrastructure, content acquisitions and marketing. New entrants may enter the market or existing providers may adjust their services with unique offerings or approaches to providing entertainment video. Companies also may enter into business combinations or alliances that strengthen their competitive positions. If we are unable to successfully or profitably compete with current and new competitors, our business will be adversely affected, and we may not be able to increase or maintain market share, revenues or profitability.\n\nWe face risks, such as unforeseen costs and potential liability in connection with content we acquire, produce, license and/or distribute through our service.\n\nAs a producer and distributor of content, we face potential liability for negligence, copyright and trademark infringement, or other claims based on the nature and content of materials that we acquire, produce, license and/or distribute. We also may face potential liability for content used in promoting our service, including marketing materials. We are devoting more resources toward the development, production, marketing and distribution of original programming, including TV series, documentaries and feature films. We believe that original programming can help differentiate our service from other offerings, enhance our brand and otherwise attract and retain members. To the extent our original programming does not meet our expectations, in particular, in terms of costs, viewing and popularity, our business, including our brand and results of operations may be adversely impacted. As we expand our original programming, we have become responsible for production costs and\n\n5', 'Table of Contents\n\nother expenses, such as ongoing guild payments. We also take on risks associated with production, such as completion and key talent risk. Negotiations or renewals related to entertainment industry collective bargaining agreements could negatively impact timing and costs associated with our productions. We contract with third parties related to the development, production, marketing and distribution of our original programming.\xa0 We may face potential liability or may suffer losses in connection with these arrangements, including but not limited to if such third parties violate applicable law, become insolvent or engage in fraudulent behavior. To the extent we create and sell physical or digital merchandise relating to our original programming, and/or license such rights to third parties, we could become subject to product liability, intellectual property or other claims related to such merchandise. We may decide to remove content from our service, not to place licensed or produced content on our service or discontinue or alter production of original content if we believe such content might not be well received by our members, or could be damaging to our brand or business.\n\nTo the extent we do not accurately anticipate costs or mitigate risks, including for content that we obtain but ultimately does not appear on or is removed from our service, or if we become liable for content we acquire, produce, license and/or distribute, our business may suffer. Litigation to defend these claims could be costly and the expenses and damages arising from any liability or unforeseen production risks could harm our results of operations. We may not be indemnified against claims or costs of these types and we may not have insurance coverage for these types of claims.\n\nIf we are not able to manage change and growth, our business could be adversely affected.\n\nWe are expanding our operations internationally, scaling our streaming service to effectively and reliably handle anticipated growth in both members and features related to our service, scaling our ability to produce original content, as well as continuing to operate our DVD service within the U.S. As our international offering evolves, we are managing and adjusting our business to address varied content offerings, consumer customs and practices, in particular those dealing with e-commerce and streaming video, as well as differing legal and regulatory environments. As we scale our streaming service, we are developing technology and utilizing third-party “cloud” computing services. As we scale our original content production, we are building out expertise in a number of disciplines, including creative, marketing, legal, finance, licensing, merchandising and other resources related to the development and physical production of content. Further, we may expand our content offering in a manner that is not well received by consumers. As we grow our operations, we may face integration and operational challenges as well as potential unknown liabilities and reputational concerns in connection with partners we work with or companies we may acquire or control. If we are not able to manage the growing complexity of our business, including improving, refining or revising our systems and operational practices related to our streaming operations and original content, our business may be adversely affected.\n\nIf we fail to maintain or, in newer markets establish, a positive reputation concerning our service, including the content we offer, we may not be able to attract or retain members, and our operating results may be adversely affected.\n\nWe believe that a positive reputation concerning our service is important in attracting and retaining members. To the extent our content, in particular, our original programming, is perceived as low quality, offensive or otherwise not compelling to consumers, our ability to establish and maintain a positive reputation may be adversely impacted. To the extent our content is deemed controversial or offensive by government regulators, we may face direct or indirect retaliatory action or behavior, including being required to remove such content from our service, our entire service could be banned and/or become subject to heightened regulatory scrutiny across our business and operations. We could also face boycotts which could adversely affect our business. Furthermore, to the extent our response to government action or our marketing, customer service and public relations efforts are not effective or result in negative reaction, our ability to establish and maintain a positive reputation may likewise be adversely impacted. With newer markets, we also need to establish our reputation with consumers and to the extent we are not successful in creating positive impressions, our business in these newer markets may be adversely impacted.\n\nChanges in how we market our service could adversely affect our marketing expenses and membership levels may be adversely affected.\n\nWe utilize a broad mix of marketing and public relations programs, including social media sites, to promote our service and content to existing and potential new members. We may limit or discontinue use or support of certain marketing sources or activities if advertising rates increase or if we become concerned that members or potential members deem certain marketing platforms or practices intrusive or damaging to our brand. If the available marketing channels are curtailed, our ability to engage members and attract new members may be adversely affected.\n\nCompanies that promote our service may decide that we negatively impact their business or may make business decisions that in turn negatively impact us. For example, if they decide that they want to compete more directly with us, enter a similar business or exclusively support our competitors, we may no longer have access to their marketing channels. We also acquire a number of members who rejoin our service having previously canceled their membership. If we are unable to maintain or\n\n6', "Table of Contents\n\nreplace our sources of members with similarly effective sources, or if the cost of our existing sources increases, our member levels and marketing expenses may be adversely affected.\n\nWe utilize marketing to promote our content and drive conversation about our content and service. To the extent we promote our content or service inefficiently or ineffectively, we may not obtain the expected acquisition and retention benefits and our business may be adversely affected.\n\nWe rely upon a number of partners to make our service available on their devices.\n\nWe currently offer members the ability to receive streaming content through a host of internet-connected devices, including TVs, digital video players, television set-top boxes and mobile devices. We have agreements with various cable, satellite and telecommunications operators to make our service available through the television set-top boxes of these service providers, some of whom may have investments in competing streaming content providers. In many instances, our agreements also include provisions by which the partner bills consumers directly for the Netflix service or otherwise offers services or products in connection with offering our service. If partners or other providers do a better job of connecting consumers with content they want to watch, for example through multi-service discovery interfaces, our service may be adversely impacted. We intend to continue to broaden our relationships with existing partners and to increase our capability to stream TV series, documentaries and feature films to other platforms and partners over time. If we are not successful in maintaining existing and creating new relationships, or if we encounter technological, content licensing, regulatory, business or other impediments to delivering our streaming content to our members via these devices, our ability to retain members and grow our business could be adversely impacted.\n\nOur agreements with our partners are typically between one and three years in duration and our business could be adversely affected if, upon expiration, a number of our partners do not continue to provide access to our service or are unwilling to do so on terms acceptable to us, which terms may include the degree of accessibility and prominence of our service. Furthermore, devices are manufactured and sold by entities other than Netflix and while these entities should be responsible for the devices’ performance, the connection between these devices and Netflix may nonetheless result in consumer dissatisfaction toward Netflix and such dissatisfaction could result in claims against us or otherwise adversely impact our business. In addition, technology changes to our streaming functionality may require that partners update their devices, or may lead to us to stop supporting the delivery of our service on certain legacy devices. If partners do not update or otherwise modify their devices, or if we discontinue support for certain devices, our service and our members' use and enjoyment could be negatively impacted.\n\nWe are subject to payment processing risk.\n\nOur members pay for our service using a variety of different payment methods, including credit and debit cards, gift cards, prepaid cards, direct debit, online wallets and direct carrier and partner billing. We rely on internal systems as well as those of third parties to process payment. Acceptance and processing of these payment methods are subject to certain rules and regulations, including additional authentication requirements for certain payment methods, and require payment of interchange and other fees. To the extent there are increases in payment processing fees, material changes in the payment ecosystem, such as large re-issuances of payment cards, delays in receiving payments from payment processors, changes to rules or regulations concerning payments, loss of payment partners and/or disruptions or failures in our payment processing systems, partner systems or payment products, including products we use to update payment information, our revenue, operating expenses and results of operation could be adversely impacted. In certain instances, we leverage third parties such as our cable and other partners to bill subscribers on our behalf. If these third parties become unwilling or unable to continue processing payments on our behalf, we would have to transition subscribers or otherwise find alternative methods of collecting payments, which could adversely impact member acquisition and retention. In addition, from time to time, we encounter fraudulent use of payment methods, which could impact our results of operations and if not adequately controlled and managed could create negative consumer perceptions of our service. If we are unable to maintain our fraud and chargeback rate at acceptable levels, card networks may impose fines, our card approval rate may be impacted and we may be subject to additional card authentication requirements. The termination of our ability to process payments on any major payment method would significantly impair our ability to operate our business.\n\nIf government regulations relating to the internet or other areas of our business change, we may need to alter the manner in which we conduct our business, or incur greater operating expenses.\n\nThe adoption or modification of laws or regulations relating to the internet or other areas of our business could limit or otherwise adversely affect the manner in which we currently conduct our business. As our service and others like us gain traction in international markets, governments are increasingly looking to introduce new or extend legacy regulations to these services, in particular those related to broadcast media and tax. For example, recent changes to European law enables individual member states to impose levies and other financial obligations on media operators located outside their jurisdiction.\n\n7", 'Table of Contents\n\nWe anticipate that several jurisdictions may, over time, impose greater financial and regulatory obligations on us. In addition, the continued growth and development of the market for online commerce may lead to more stringent consumer protection laws, which may impose additional burdens on us. If we are required to comply with new regulations or legislation or new interpretations of existing regulations or legislation, this compliance could cause us to incur additional expenses or alter our business model.\n\nChanges in laws or regulations that adversely affect the growth, popularity or use of the internet, including laws impacting net neutrality, could decrease the demand for our service and increase our cost of doing business. Certain laws intended to prevent network operators from discriminating against the legal traffic that traverse their networks have been implemented in many countries, including across the European Union. In others, the laws may be nascent or non-existent. Furthermore, favorable laws may change, including for example, in the United States where net neutrality regulations were repealed. Given uncertainty around these rules, including changing interpretations, amendments or repeal, coupled with potentially significant political and economic power of local network operators, we could experience discriminatory or anti-competitive practices that could impede our growth, cause us to incur additional expense or otherwise negatively affect our business.\n\nRisks Related to Intellectual Property\n\nIf studios, content providers or other rights holders refuse to license streaming content or other rights upon terms acceptable to us, our business could be adversely affected.\n\nOur ability to provide our members with content they can watch depends on studios, content providers and other rights holders licensing rights, including distribution rights, to such content and certain related elements thereof, such as the public performance of music contained within the content we distribute. The license periods and the terms and conditions of such licenses vary. As content providers develop their own streaming services, they may be unwilling to provide us with access to certain content, including popular series or movies. If the studios, content providers and other rights holders are not or are no longer willing or able to license us content upon terms acceptable to us, our ability to stream content to our members may be adversely affected and/or our costs could increase. Certain licenses for content provide for the studios or other content providers to withdraw content from our service relatively quickly. Because of these provisions as well as other actions we may take, content available through our service can be withdrawn on short notice. As competition increases, we see the cost of certain programming increase. As we seek to differentiate our service, we are often focused on securing certain exclusive rights when obtaining content, including original content. We are also focused on programming an overall mix of content that delights our members in a cost efficient manner. Within this context, we are selective about the titles we add and renew to our service. If we do not maintain a compelling mix of content, our membership acquisition and retention may be adversely affected.\n\nMusic and certain authors’ performances contained within content we distribute may require us to obtain licenses for such distribution. In this regard, we engage in negotiations with collection management organizations (“CMOs”) that hold certain rights to music and/or other interests in connection with streaming content into various territories. If we are unable to reach mutually acceptable terms with these organizations, we could become involved in litigation and/or could be enjoined from distributing certain content, which could adversely impact our business. Additionally, pending and ongoing litigation as well as negotiations between certain CMOs and other third parties in various territories could adversely impact our negotiations with CMOs, or result in music publishers represented by certain CMOs unilaterally withdrawing rights, and thereby adversely impact our ability to reach licensing agreements reasonably acceptable to us. Failure to reach such licensing agreements could expose us to potential liability for copyright infringement or otherwise increase our costs. Additionally, as the market for the digital distribution of content grows, a broader role for CMOs in the remuneration of authors, performers and other rights holders could expose us to greater distribution expenses.\n\nIf our trademarks and other proprietary rights are not adequately protected to prevent use or appropriation by our competitors, the value of our brand and other intangible assets may be diminished, and our business may be adversely affected.\n\nWe rely and expect to continue to rely on a combination of confidentiality and license agreements with our employees, consultants and third parties with whom we have relationships, as well as trademark, copyright, patent and trade secret protection laws, to protect our proprietary rights. We may also seek to enforce our proprietary rights through court proceedings or other legal actions. We have filed and we expect to file from time to time for trademark and patent applications. Nevertheless, these applications may not be approved, third parties may challenge any copyrights, patents or trademarks issued to or held by us, third parties may knowingly or unknowingly infringe our intellectual property rights, and we may not be able to prevent infringement or misappropriation without substantial expense to us. If the protection of our intellectual property rights is inadequate to prevent use or misappropriation by third parties, the value of our brand, content, and other intangible assets may be diminished, competitors may be able to more effectively mimic our service and methods of operations, the\n\n8', 'Table of Contents\n\nperception of our business and service to members and potential members may become confused in the marketplace, and our ability to attract members may be adversely affected.\n\nWe currently hold various domain names relating to our brand, including Netflix.com. Failure to protect our domain names could adversely affect our reputation and brand and make it more difficult for users to find our website and our service. We may be unable, without significant cost or at all, to prevent third parties from acquiring domain names that are similar to, infringe upon or otherwise decrease the value of our trademarks and other proprietary rights.\n\nIntellectual property claims against us could be costly and result in the loss of significant rights related to, among other things, our website, streaming technology, our recommendation and merchandising technology, title selection processes, our content, and marketing activities.\n\nTrademark, copyright, patent and other intellectual property rights are important to us and other companies. Our intellectual property rights extend to our technology, business processes and the content we produce and distribute through our service. We use the intellectual property of third parties in creating some of our content, merchandising our products and marketing our service. From time to time, third parties allege that we have violated their intellectual property rights. If we are unable to obtain sufficient rights, successfully defend our use, or develop non-infringing technology or otherwise alter our business practices on a timely basis in response to claims against us for infringement, misappropriation, misuse or other violation of third-party intellectual property rights, our business and competitive position may be adversely affected. Many companies are devoting significant resources to developing patents that could potentially affect many aspects of our business. There are numerous patents that broadly claim means and methods of conducting business on the internet. We have not searched patents relative to our technology. Defending ourselves against intellectual property claims, whether they are with or without merit or are determined in our favor, results in costly litigation and diversion of technical and management personnel. It also may result in our inability to use our current website, streaming technology, our recommendation and merchandising technology or inability to market our service or merchandise our products. We may also have to remove content from our service, or remove consumer products or marketing materials from the marketplace. As a result of a dispute, we may have to develop non-infringing technology, enter into royalty or licensing agreements, adjust our content, merchandising or marketing activities or take other actions to resolve the claims. These actions, if required, may be costly or unavailable on terms acceptable to us.\n\nRisks Related to Information Technology\n\nAny significant disruption in or unauthorized access to our computer systems or those of third parties that we utilize in our operations, including those relating to cybersecurity or arising from cyber-attacks, could result in a loss or degradation of service, unauthorized disclosure of data, including member and corporate information, or theft of intellectual property, including digital content assets, which could adversely impact our business.\n\nOur reputation and ability to attract, retain and serve our members is dependent upon the reliable performance and security of our computer systems and those of third parties that we utilize in our operations. These systems may be subject to damage or interruption from, among other things, earthquakes, adverse weather conditions, other natural disasters, terrorist attacks, rogue employees, power loss, telecommunications failures, and cybersecurity risks. Interruptions in these systems, or with the internet in general, could make our service unavailable or degraded or otherwise hinder our ability to deliver our service. Service interruptions, errors in our software or the unavailability of computer systems used in our operations could diminish the overall attractiveness of our membership service to existing and potential members.\n\nOur computer systems and those of third parties we use in our operations are subject to cybersecurity threats, including cyber-attacks such as computer viruses, denial of service attacks, physical or electronic break-ins and similar disruptions. These systems periodically experience directed attacks intended to lead to interruptions and delays in our service and operations as well as loss, misuse or theft of personal information and other data, confidential information or intellectual property. Additionally, outside parties may attempt to induce employees or users to disclose sensitive or confidential information in order to gain access to data. Any attempt by hackers to obtain our data (including member and corporate information) or intellectual property (including digital content assets), disrupt our service, or otherwise access our systems, or those of third parties we use, if successful, could harm our business, be expensive to remedy and damage our reputation. We have implemented certain systems and processes to thwart hackers and protect our data and systems, but the techniques used to gain unauthorized access to data and software are constantly evolving, and we may be unable to anticipate or prevent unauthorized access. Because of our prominence, we (and/or third parties we use) may be a particularly attractive target for such attacks, and from time to time, we have experienced an unauthorized release of certain digital content assets. However, to date these unauthorized releases have not had a material impact on our service, systems or business. There is no assurance that hackers may not have a material impact on our service or systems in the future. Our insurance does not cover expenses related to such disruptions or unauthorized access. Efforts to prevent hackers from disrupting our service or otherwise accessing our systems are expensive to develop, implement and maintain. These efforts require ongoing monitoring and updating as technologies change and efforts\n\n9', 'Table of Contents\n\nto overcome security measures become more sophisticated, and may limit the functionality of or otherwise negatively impact our service offering and systems. Any significant disruption to our service or access to our systems could result in a loss of memberships and adversely affect our business and results of operation. Further, a penetration of our systems or a third-party’s systems or other misappropriation or misuse of personal information could subject us to business, regulatory, litigation and reputation risk, which could have a negative effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\nWe utilize our own communications and computer hardware systems located either in our facilities or in that of a third-party provider. In addition, we utilize third-party “cloud” computing services in connection with our business operations. We also utilize our own and third-party content delivery networks to help us stream TV series, documentaries and feature films in high volume to Netflix members over the internet. Problems faced by us or our third-party “cloud” computing or other network providers, including technological or business-related disruptions, as well as cybersecurity threats and regulatory interference, could adversely impact the experience of our members.\n\nWe rely upon Amazon Web Services to operate certain aspects of our service and any disruption of or interference with our use of the Amazon Web Services operation would impact our operations and our business would be adversely impacted.\n\nAmazon Web Services (“AWS”) provides a distributed computing infrastructure platform for business operations, or what is commonly referred to as a "cloud" computing service. We have architected our software and computer systems so as to utilize data processing, storage capabilities and other services provided by AWS. Currently, we run the vast majority of our computing on AWS. Given this, along with the fact that we cannot easily switch our AWS operations to another cloud provider, any disruption of or interference with our use of AWS would impact our operations and our business would be adversely impacted. While the retail side of Amazon competes with us, we do not believe that Amazon will use the AWS operation in such a manner as to gain competitive advantage against our service, although if it was to do so it could harm our business.\n\nIf the technology we use in operating our business fails, is unavailable, or does not operate to expectations, our business and results of operation could be adversely impacted.\n\nWe utilize a combination of proprietary and third-party technology to operate our business. This includes the technology that we have developed to recommend and merchandise content to our consumers as well as enable fast and efficient delivery of content to our members and their various consumer electronic devices. For example, we have built and deployed our own content-delivery network (“CDN”). To the extent Internet Service Providers (“ISPs”) do not interconnect with our CDN or charge us to access their networks, or if we experience difficulties in our CDN’s operation, our ability to efficiently and effectively deliver our streaming content to our members could be adversely impacted and our business and results of operation could be adversely affected. Likewise, if our recommendation and merchandising technology does not enable us to predict and recommend titles that our members will enjoy, our ability to attract and retain members may be adversely affected. We also utilize third-party technology to help market our service, process payments, and otherwise manage the daily operations of our business. If our technology or that of third-parties we utilize in our operations fails or otherwise operates improperly, including as a result of “bugs” in our development and deployment of software, our ability to operate our service, retain existing members and add new members may be impaired. Any harm to our members’ personal computers or other devices caused by software used in our operations could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\n\nChanges in how network operators handle and charge for access to data that travel across their networks could adversely impact our business.\n\nWe rely upon the ability of consumers to access our service through the internet. If network operators block, restrict or otherwise impair access to our service over their networks, our service and business could be negatively affected. To the extent that network operators implement usage based pricing, including meaningful bandwidth caps, or otherwise try to monetize access to their networks by data providers, we could incur greater operating expenses and our membership acquisition and retention could be negatively impacted. Furthermore, to the extent network operators create tiers of internet access service and either charge us for or prohibit us from being available through these tiers, our business could be negatively impacted.\n\nMost network operators that provide consumers with access to the internet also provide these consumers with multichannel video programming. As such, many network operators have an incentive to use their network infrastructure in a manner adverse to our continued growth and success. While we believe that consumer demand, regulatory oversight and competition will help check these incentives, to the extent that network operators are able to provide preferential treatment to their data as opposed to ours or otherwise implement discriminatory network management practices, our business could be negatively impacted. The extent to which these incentives limit operator behavior differs across markets.\n\n10', 'Table of Contents\n\nRisks Related to Privacy\n\nPrivacy concerns could limit our ability to collect and leverage member personal information and other data and disclosure of member personal information and other data could adversely impact our business and reputation.\n\nIn the ordinary course of business and in particular in connection with content acquisition and merchandising our service to our members, we collect and utilize information supplied by our members, which may include personal information and other data. We currently face certain regulatory requirements regarding the manner in which we treat such information, including but not limited to Regulation (EU) 2016/679 (also known as the General Data Protection Regulation or “GDPR”) and the California Consumer Privacy Act ("CCPA"). Any actual or perceived failure to comply with the GDPR, the CCPA, other data privacy laws or regulations, or related contractual or other obligations, or any perceived privacy rights violation, could lead to investigations, claims, and proceedings by governmental entities and private parties, damages for contract breach, and other significant costs, penalties, and other liabilities, as well as harm to our reputation and market position.\n\nOther businesses have been criticized by privacy groups and governmental bodies for attempts to link personal identities and other information to data collected on the internet regarding users’ browsing and other habits. Increased regulation of data utilization practices, including self-regulation or findings under existing laws that limit our ability to collect, transfer and use information and other data, could have an adverse effect on our business. In addition, if we were to disclose information and other data about our members in a manner that was objectionable to them, our business reputation could be adversely affected, and we could face potential legal claims that could impact our operating results. Internationally, we may become subject to additional and/or more stringent legal obligations concerning our treatment of customer and other personal information, such as laws regarding data localization and/or restrictions on data export. Failure to comply with these obligations could subject us to liability, and to the extent that we need to alter our business model or practices to adapt to these obligations, we could incur additional expenses.\n\nOur reputation and relationships with members would be harmed if member personal information and other data, particularly billing data, were to be accessed by unauthorized persons.\n\nWe maintain personal information and other data regarding our members, including names and billing information. This information and data is maintained on our own systems as well as that of third parties we use in our operations. With respect to billing information, such as credit card numbers, we rely on encryption and authentication technology to secure such information. We take measures to protect against unauthorized intrusion into our members’ information and other data. Despite these measures we, our payment processing services or other third-party services we use such as AWS, could experience an unauthorized intrusion into our members’ information and other data. In the event of such a breach, current and potential members may become unwilling to provide the information to us necessary for them to remain or become members. We also may be required to notify regulators about any actual or perceived data breach (including various state Attorneys General, one or more EU data protection authorities, or other data protection authorities) as well as the individuals who are affected by the incident within strict time periods. Additionally, we could face legal claims or regulatory fines or penalties for such a breach. The costs relating to any data breach could be material, and we currently do not carry insurance against the risk of a data breach. We also maintain personal information and other data concerning our employees, as well as personal information of others working on our productions. Should an unauthorized intrusion into our members’ or employees’ personal information and other data and/or production personal information occur, our business could be adversely affected and our larger reputation with respect to data protection could be negatively impacted.\n\nRisks Related to Liquidity\n\nThe long-term and largely fixed cost nature of our content commitments may limit our operating flexibility and could adversely affect our liquidity and results of operations.\n\nIn connection with licensing streaming content, we typically enter into multi-year commitments with studios and other content providers. We also enter into multi-year commitments for content that we produce, either directly or through third parties, including elements associated with these productions such as non-cancelable commitments under talent agreements. The payment terms of these agreements are not tied to member usage or the size of our membership base (“fixed cost”) but may be determined by costs of production or tied to such factors as titles licensed and/or theatrical exhibition receipts. Such commitments, to the extent estimable under accounting standards, are included in the Contractual Obligations section of Part II, Item 7, "Management\'s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" and Note 7, Commitments and Contingencies in the accompanying notes to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8, "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Given the multiple-year duration and largely fixed cost nature of content commitments, if membership acquisition and retention do not meet our expectations, our margins may be adversely impacted. Payment terms for certain content commitments, such as content we directly produce, will typically\n\n11', 'Table of Contents\n\nrequire more up-front cash payments than other content licenses or arrangements whereby we do not cashflow the production of such content. To the extent membership and/or revenue growth do not meet our expectations, our liquidity and results of operations could be adversely affected as a result of content commitments and accelerated payment requirements of certain agreements. In addition, the long-term and fixed cost nature of our content commitments may limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to changes in our business and the market segments in which we operate. If we license and/or produce content that is not favorably received by consumers in a territory, or is unable to be shown in a territory, acquisition and retention may be adversely impacted and given the long-term and fixed cost nature of our content commitments, we may not be able to adjust our content offering quickly and our results of operation may be adversely impacted.\n\nWe may seek additional capital that may result in stockholder dilution or that may have rights senior to those of our common stockholders.\n\nFrom time to time, we may seek to obtain additional capital, either through equity, equity-linked or debt securities. For several years prior to 2020, our cash flows from operations were negative and to the extent that it becomes negative in the future we may need to seek additional capital. The decision to obtain additional capital will depend on, among other things, our business plans, operating performance and condition of the capital markets. Any disruption in the capital markets could make it more difficult and expensive for us to raise additional capital or refinance our existing indebtedness. If we raise additional funds through the issuance of equity, equity-linked or debt securities, those securities may have rights, preferences or privileges senior to the rights of our common stock, and our stockholders may experience dilution. Any large equity or equity-linked offering could also negatively impact our stock price.\n\nWe have a substantial amount of indebtedness and other obligations, including streaming content obligations, which could adversely affect our financial position.\n\nWe have a substantial amount of indebtedness and other obligations, including streaming content obligations. Moreover, we may incur additional indebtedness in the future and incur other obligations, including additional streaming content obligations. If the financial markets become difficult or costly to access, our ability to raise additional capital may be negatively impacted. As of December\xa031, 2020, we had the equivalent of $16.4 billion aggregate principal amount of senior notes outstanding (“Notes”), some of which is denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. In addition, we have entered into a revolving credit agreement that provides for a $750 million unsecured revolving credit facility. As of December\xa031, 2020, we have not borrowed any amount under this revolving credit facility. As of December\xa031, 2020, we had approximately $7.0 billion of total content liabilities as reflected on our consolidated balance sheet, some of which is denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Such amount does not include streaming content commitments that do not meet the criteria for liability recognition, the amounts of which are significant. For more information on our streaming content obligations, including those not on our consolidated balance sheet, see Note 7, Commitments and Contingencies in the accompanying notes to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8, "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Our substantial indebtedness and other obligations, including streaming content obligations, may:\n\n•make it difficult for us to satisfy our financial obligations, including making scheduled principal and interest payments on our Notes and our other obligations;\n\n•limit our ability to borrow additional funds for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions or other general business purposes;\n\n•increase our cost of borrowing;\n\n•limit our ability to use our cash flow or obtain additional financing for future working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions or other general business purposes;\n\n•require us to use a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to make debt service payments and pay our other obligations when due;\n\n•limit our flexibility to plan for, or react to, changes in our business and industry;\n\n•place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our less leveraged competitors; and\n\n•increase our vulnerability to the impact of adverse economic and industry conditions, including changes in interest rates and foreign exchange rates.\n\nOur streaming obligations include large multi-year commitments. As a result, we may be unable to react to any downturn in the economy or reduction in our cash flows from operations by reducing our streaming content obligations in the near-term. This could result in our needing to access the capital markets at an unfavorable time, which may negatively impact our stock price.\n\n12', 'Table of Contents\n\nThe interest rate of borrowings under our revolving credit agreement makes reference to an adjusted London interbank offered rate ("LIBO Rate"). It is possible that beginning in 2022, the LIBO Rate will be discontinued as a reference rate. Under our revolving credit agreement, in the event of the discontinuance of the LIBO Rate, a mutually agreed-upon alternate benchmark rate will be established to replace the LIBO Rate.\xa0 In the event that an agreement cannot be reached on an appropriate benchmark rate, the availability of borrowings under our revolving credit agreement could be adversely impacted.\n\nWe may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service our debt and other obligations.\n\nOur ability to make payments on our debt, including our Notes, and our other obligations will depend on our financial and operating performance, which is subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions and to certain financial, business and other factors beyond our control. For several years prior to 2020, our cash flows from operations were negative. We may be unable to attain a level of cash flows from operating activities sufficient to permit us to pay the principal, premium, if any, and interest on our debt, including the Notes, and other obligations, including amounts due under our streaming content obligations.\n\nIf we are unable to service our debt and other obligations from cash flows, we may need to refinance or restructure all or a portion of such obligations prior to maturity. Our ability to refinance or restructure our debt and other obligations will depend upon the condition of the capital markets and our financial condition at such time. Any refinancing or restructuring could be at higher interest rates and may require us to comply with more onerous covenants, which could further restrict our business operations. If our cash flows are insufficient to service our debt and other obligations, we may not be able to refinance or restructure any of these obligations on commercially reasonable terms or at all and any refinancing or restructuring could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition.\n\nIf our cash flows are insufficient to fund our debt and other obligations and we are unable to refinance or restructure these obligations, we could face substantial liquidity problems and may be forced to reduce or delay investments and capital expenditures, or to sell material assets or operations to meet our debt and other obligations. We cannot assure you that we would be able to implement any of these alternative measures on satisfactory terms or at all or that the proceeds from such alternatives would be adequate to meet any debt or other obligations when due. If it becomes necessary to implement any of these alternative measures, our business, results of operations, or financial condition could be materially and adversely affected.\n\nRisks Related to International Operations\n\nWe could be subject to economic, political, regulatory and other risks arising from our international operations.\n\nOperating in international markets requires significant resources and management attention and will subject us to economic, political, regulatory and other risks that may be different from or incremental to those in the U.S. In addition to the risks that we face in the U.S., our international operations involve risks that could adversely affect our business, including:\n\n•the need to adapt our content and user interfaces for specific cultural and language differences;\n\n•difficulties and costs associated with staffing and managing foreign operations;\n\n•political or social unrest and economic instability;\n\n•compliance with laws such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, UK Bribery Act and other anti-corruption laws, export controls and economic sanctions, and local laws prohibiting corrupt payments to government officials;\n\n•difficulties in understanding and complying with local laws, regulations and customs in foreign jurisdictions, including local ownership requirements for streaming content providers;\n\n•regulatory requirements or government action against our service, whether in response to enforcement of actual or purported legal and regulatory requirements or otherwise, that results in disruption or non-availability of our service or particular content in the applicable jurisdiction;\n\n•foreign intellectual property laws, such as the EU copyright directive, or changes to such laws, which may be less favorable than U.S. law and, among other issues, may impact the economics of creating or distributing content, anti-piracy efforts, or our ability to protect or exploit intellectual property rights;\n\n•adverse tax consequences such as those related to changes in tax laws or tax rates or their interpretations, and the related application of judgment in determining our global provision for income taxes, deferred tax assets or liabilities or other tax liabilities given the ultimate tax determination is uncertain;\n\n•fluctuations in currency exchange rates, which we do not use foreign exchange contracts or derivatives to hedge against and which will impact revenues and expenses of our international operations and expose us to foreign currency exchange rate risk;\n\n•profit repatriation and other restrictions on the transfer of funds;\n\n13', 'Table of Contents\n\n•differing payment processing systems as well as consumer use and acceptance of electronic payment methods, such as payment cards;\n\n•new and different sources of competition;\n\n•censorship requirements that cause us to remove or edit popular content, leading to consumer disappointment, brand tarnishment or dissatisfaction with our service;\n\n•low usage and/or penetration of internet-connected consumer electronic devices;\n\n•different and more stringent user protection, data protection, privacy and other laws, including data localization and/or restrictions on data export, and local ownership requirements;\n\n•availability of reliable broadband connectivity and wide area networks in targeted areas for expansion;\n\n•differing, and often more lenient, laws and consumer understanding/attitudes regarding the illegality of piracy;\n\n•negative impacts from trade disputes; and\n\n•implementation of regulations designed to stimulate the local production of film and TV series in order to promote and preserve local culture and economic activity, including local content quotas, investment obligations, and levies to support local film funds. For example, the European Union revised its Audio Visual Media Services Directive in 2018 to require that European works comprise at least thirty (30) percent of media service providers’ catalogs, and to require prominence of those works.\n\nOur failure to manage any of these risks successfully could harm our international operations and our overall business, and results of our operations.\n\nWe are subject to taxation related risks in multiple jurisdictions.\n\nWe are a U.S.-based multinational company subject to tax in multiple U.S. and foreign tax jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in determining our global provision for income taxes, deferred tax assets or liabilities and in evaluating our tax positions on a worldwide basis. While we believe our tax positions are consistent with the tax laws in the jurisdictions in which we conduct our business, it is possible that these positions may be challenged by jurisdictional tax authorities, which may have a significant impact on our global provision for income taxes.\n\nTax laws are being re-examined and evaluated globally. New laws and interpretations of the law are taken into account for financial statement purposes in the quarter or year that they become applicable. Tax authorities are increasingly scrutinizing the tax positions of companies and we have tax audits pending in several jurisdictions. Many U.S. states, countries in the European Union, as well as a number of other countries and organizations such as the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, are actively considering changes to existing tax laws that, if enacted, could increase our tax obligations in jurisdictions where we do business. If U.S. or other foreign tax authorities change applicable tax laws, our overall taxes could increase, and our business, financial condition or results of operations may be adversely impacted.\n\nRisks Related to Human Resources\n\nWe may lose key employees or may be unable to hire qualified employees.\n\nWe rely on the continued service of our senior management, including our Co-Chief Executive Officers, Reed Hastings and Ted Sarandos, members of our executive team and other key employees and the hiring of new qualified employees. In our industry, there is substantial and continuous competition for highly-skilled business, product development, technical, creative and other personnel. If we experience high executive turnover, are not successful in recruiting new personnel or in retaining and motivating existing personnel, in instilling our culture in new employees, or improving our culture as we grow, our operations may be disrupted.\n\nLabor disputes may have an adverse effect on the Company’s business.\n\nOur partners, suppliers, vendors and we employ the services of writers, directors, actors and other talent as well as trade employees and others who are subject to collective bargaining agreements in the motion picture industry, both in the U.S. and internationally. Expiring collective bargaining agreements may be renewed on terms that are unfavorable to us. If expiring collective bargaining agreements cannot be renewed, then it is possible that the affected unions could take action in the form of strikes or work stoppages. Such actions, as well as higher costs or operating complexities in connection with these collective bargaining agreements or a significant labor dispute, could have an adverse effect on our business by causing delays in production, added costs or by reducing profit margins.\n\n14', 'Table of Contents\n\nRisks Related to Our Stock Ownership\n\nProvisions in our charter documents and under Delaware law could discourage a takeover that stockholders may consider favorable.\n\nOur charter documents may discourage, delay or prevent a merger or acquisition that a stockholder may consider favorable because they:\n\n•authorize our board of directors, without stockholder approval, to issue up to 10,000,000 shares of undesignated preferred stock;\n\n•provide for a classified board of directors;\n\n•prohibit our stockholders from acting by written consent;\n\n•establish advance notice requirements for proposing matters to be approved by stockholders at stockholder meetings; and\n\n•prohibit stockholders from calling a special meeting of stockholders.\n\nAs a Delaware corporation, we are also subject to certain Delaware anti-takeover provisions. Under Delaware law, a corporation may not engage in a business combination with any holder of 15% or more of its capital stock unless the holder has held the stock for three years or, among other things, the board of directors has approved the transaction. Our board of directors could rely on Delaware law to prevent or delay an acquisition of us.\n\nIn addition, a merger or acquisition may trigger retention payments to certain executive employees under the terms of our Amended and Restated Executive Severance and Retention Incentive Plan, thereby increasing the cost of such a transaction.\n\nOur stock price is volatile.\n\nThe price at which our common stock has traded has fluctuated significantly. The price may continue to be volatile due to a number of factors including the following, some of which are beyond our control:\n\n•variations in our operating results, including our membership acquisition and retention, revenues, operating income, net income, net cash provided by operating activities and free cash flow;\n\n•variations between our actual operating results and the expectations of securities analysts, investors and the financial community;\n\n•announcements of developments affecting our business, systems or expansion plans by us or others;\n\n•competition, including the introduction of new competitors, their pricing strategies and services;\n\n•market volatility in general;\n\n•the level of demand for our stock, including the amount of short interest in our stock;\n\n•the impact of any future stock repurchase program we may adopt;\n\n•the operating results of our competitors; and\n\n•other risks and uncertainties described in these risk factors.\n\nAs a result of these and other factors, investors in our common stock may not be able to resell their shares at or above their original purchase price.\n\nFollowing certain periods of volatility in the market price of our securities, we became the subject of securities litigation. We may experience more such litigation following future periods of volatility. This type of litigation may result in substantial costs and a diversion of management’s attention and resources.\n\nPreparing and forecasting our financial results requires us to make judgments and estimates which may differ materially from actual results.\n\nGiven the dynamic nature of our business, and the inherent limitations in predicting the future, forecasts of our revenues, operating margins, net income and number of paid membership additions and other financial and operating data may differ materially from actual results. Such discrepancies could cause a decline in the trading price of our common stock. In addition, the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America also requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported periods. We base such estimates on historical experience and on various other\n\n15', "Table of Contents\n\nassumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, but actual results may differ from these estimates. For example, we estimate the content amortization pattern, beginning with the month of first availability, of any particular licensed or produced television series, documentary or feature film based upon various factors including historical and estimated viewing patterns. If actual viewing patterns differ from these estimates, the pattern and/or period of amortization would be changed and could affect the timing or recognition of content amortization. If we revise such estimates it could result in greater in-period expenses, which could cause us to miss our earnings guidance or negatively impact the results we report which could negatively impact our stock price.\n\nGeneral Risk Factors\n\nWe are engaged in legal proceedings that could cause us to incur unforeseen expenses and could occupy a significant amount of our management's time and attention.\n\nFrom time to time, we are subject to litigation or claims that could negatively affect our business operations and financial position. As we have grown, we have seen a rise in the number of litigation matters against us. These matters have included copyright and other claims related to our content, patent infringement claims, tax litigation, employment related litigation, as well as consumer and securities class actions, each of which are typically expensive to defend. Litigation disputes could cause us to incur unforeseen expenses, result in content unavailability, service disruptions, and otherwise occupy a significant amount of our management's time and attention, any of which could negatively affect our business operations and financial position. We also from time to time receive inquiries and subpoenas and other types of information requests from government authorities and we may become subject to related claims and other actions related to our business activities. While the ultimate outcome of investigations, inquiries, information requests and related legal proceedings is difficult to predict, such matters can be expensive, time-consuming and distracting, and adverse resolutions or settlements of those matters may result in, among other things, modification of our business practices, reputational harm or costs and significant payments, any of which could negatively affect our business operations and financial position.\n\nItem 1B.Unresolved Staff Comments\n\nNone.\n\n16", 'Table of Contents\n\nItem 2.Properties\n\nWe have leased principal properties in both Los Gatos, California, which is the location of our corporate headquarters, and in Los Angeles, California.

The increase in our consolidated revenues was due to the 24% growth in average paying memberships and a 1% increase in average monthly revenue per paying membership. The increase in average monthly revenue per paying membership resulted from our price changes and plan mix, partially offset by unfavorable fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. Paid net membership additions for the year ended December\xa031, 2020 increased 31% as compared to the year ended December\xa031, 2019, as a result of the long term trend toward streaming on demand entertainment and due to the COVID-19 pandemic and resulting social restrictions and local government mandates of home confinement in certain jurisdictions.\n\nThe increase in operating margin is due primarily to increased revenues and decreased marketing costs, coupled with cost of revenues, technology and development, and general and administrative costs growing at a slower rate as compared to the 24% increase in revenues.\n\nThe full extent of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, operations and financial results will depend on numerous evolving factors that we may not be able to accurately predict. See Item 1A: "Risk Factors" section set forth in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional details. In an effort to protect the health and safety of our employees, our workforce has had and continues in most instances to spend a significant amount of time working from home, international travel has been severely curtailed and many of our productions continue to experience disruption, as are the productions of our third-party content suppliers. Our other partners have similarly had their operations disrupted, including those partners that we use for our operations as well as development, production, and post-production of content. While we and our partners have resumed productions and related operations in many parts of the world, our ability to produce content remains affected by the pandemic. In an effort to contain COVID-19 or slow its spread, governments around the world have also enacted various measures, some of which have been subsequently rescinded, modified or reinstated, including orders to close all businesses not deemed “essential,” isolate residents to their homes or places of residence, and practice social distancing. We anticipate that these actions and the global health crisis caused by COVID-19, including any resurgences, will continue to negatively impact business activity across the globe. We will continue to actively monitor the situation and may take further actions that alter our business operations as may be required by federal, state, local or foreign authorities, or that we determine are in the best interests of our employees, customers,\n\n22', 'Table of Contents\n\npartners and stockholders. It is not clear what the potential effects any such alterations or modifications may have on our business, including the effects on our customers, suppliers or vendors, or on our financial results.\n\nStreaming Revenues\n\nWe derive revenues from monthly membership fees for services related to streaming content to our members. We offer a variety of streaming membership plans, the price of which varies by country and the features of the plan. As of December 31, 2020, pricing on our plans ranged from the U.S. dollar equivalent of $2 to $24 per month. We expect that from time to time the prices of our membership plans in each country may change and we may test other plan and price variations.\n\nThe following tables summarize streaming revenue and

and a method of payment being provided, and that is not part of a free trial or certain other promotions that may be offered by the Company to new or rejoining members. A membership is canceled and ceases to be reflected in the above metrics as of the effective cancellation date. Voluntary cancellations generally become effective at the end of the prepaid membership period. Involuntary cancellations, as a result of a failed method of payment, become effective immediately. Memberships are assigned to territories based on the geographic location used at time of sign-up as determined by the Company’s internal systems, which utilize industry standard geo-location technology.\n\n(2) We believe constant currency information is useful in analyzing the underlying trends in average monthly revenue per paying membership. In order to exclude the effect of foreign currency rate fluctuations on average monthly revenue per paying membership, we estimate current period revenue assuming foreign exchange rates had remained constant with foreign exchange rates from each of the corresponding months of the prior-year period. For the year ended December\xa031, 2020, our revenues would have been approximately $596\xa0million higher had foreign currency exchange rates remained constant with those for the year ended December\xa031, 2019.\n\nCost of Revenues\n\nAmortization of content assets makes up the majority of cost of revenues. Expenses associated with the acquisition, licensing and production of content (such as payroll and related personnel expenses, costs associated with obtaining rights to music included in our content, overall deals with talent, miscellaneous production related costs and participations and residuals), streaming delivery costs and other operations costs make up the remainder of cost of revenues. We have built our own global content delivery network (“Open Connect”) to help us efficiently stream a high volume of content to our members over the internet. Delivery expenses, therefore, include equipment costs related to Open Connect, payroll and related personnel expenses and all third-party costs, such as cloud computing costs, associated with delivering content over the internet. Other operations costs include customer service and payment processing fees, including those we pay to our integrated payment partners, as well as other costs incurred in making our content available to members.\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|  | | |  | | | Year Ended December 31, | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |  | | | Change | | | | | | | | |\n|  | | |  | | | 2020 | | |  | | | 2019 | | |  | | | 2018 | | |  | | | 2020 vs. 2019 | | | | | | | | |\n|  | | |  | | | (in\xa0thousands,\xa0except\xa0percentages) | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |\n| Cost of revenues | | |  | | | $ | 15,276,319 |  |  | | | $ | 12,440,213 |  |  | | | $ | 9,967,538 |  |  | | | $ | 2,836,106 |  |  | | | 23 | | % |\n| As a percentage of revenues | | |  | | | 61 | | % |  | | | 62 | | % |  | | | 63 | | % |  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |\n\nThe increase in cost of revenues for the year ended December\xa031, 2020 as compared to the year ended December\xa031, 2019 was primarily due to a $1,591 million increase in content amortization relating to our existing and new content, including more exclusive and original programming. Expenses associated with the acquisition, licensing and production of content increased $1,101 million, primarily due to expenses related to the COVID-19 pandemic and continued growth in our content production activities. Streaming delivery costs and other operations costs increased driven by our growing member base.\n\nMarketing\n\nMarketing expenses consist primarily of advertising expenses and certain payments made to our marketing partners, including consumer electronics ("CE") manufacturers, MVPDs, mobile operators and ISPs.

See Note 6 Debt in the accompanying notes to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8, "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further detail on our debt obligations.\n\n25', 'Table of Contents\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|  | | |  | | | Year Ended December\xa031, | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |  | | | Change | | | | | | | | |\n|  | | |  | | | 2020 | | |  | | | 2019 | | |  | | | 2018 | | |  | | | 2020 vs. 2019 | | | | | | | | |\n|  | | |  | | | (in thousands, except percentages) | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |\n| Interest expense | | |  | | | $ | 767,499 |  |  | | | $ | 626,023 |  |  | | | $ | 420,493 |  |  | | | $ | 141,476 |  |  | | | 23 | | % |\n| As a percentage of revenues | | |  | | | 3 | | % |  | | | 3 | | % |  | | | 3 | | % |  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |\n\nInterest expense for the year ended December\xa031, 2020 consisted primarily of $749 million of interest on our Notes. The increase in interest expense for the year ended December\xa031, 2020 as compared to the year ended December\xa031, 2019 is due to the increase in debt.\n\nInterest and Other Income (Expense)\n\nInterest and other income (expense) consists primarily of foreign exchange gains and losses on foreign currency denominated balances and interest earned on cash and cash equivalents.\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|  | | |  | | | Year Ended December 31, | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |  | | | Change | | | | | | | | |\n|  | | |  | | | 2020 | | |  | | | 2019 | | |  | | | 2018 | | |  | | | 2020 vs. 2019 | | | | | | | | |\n|  | | |  | | | (in thousands, except percentages) | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |\n| Interest and other income (expense) | | |  | | | $ | (618,441) |  |  | | | $ | 84,000 |  |  | | | $ | 41,725 |  |  | | | $ | (702,441) |  |  | | | (836) | | % |\n| As a percentage of revenues | | |  | | | (2) | | % |  | | | — | | % |  | | | — | | % |  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |\n\nInterest and other income (expense) decreased primarily due to foreign exchange losses of $660 million for the year ended December\xa031, 2020 as compared to a gain of $7\xa0million for the year ended December\xa031, 2019. The foreign exchange loss in the year ended December\xa031, 2020 was primarily driven by the non-cash $533 million loss from the remeasurement of our Senior Notes denominated in euros, coupled with the remeasurement of cash and content liability positions in currencies other than the functional currencies.\n\nProvision for Income Taxes\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|  | | |  | | | Year Ended December\xa031, | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |  | | | Change | | | | | | | | |\n|  | | |  | | | 2020 | | |  | | | 2019 | | |  | | | 2018 | | |  | | | 2020 vs. 2019 | | | | | | | | |\n|  | | |  | | | (in thousands, except percentages) | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |\n| Provision for income taxes | | |  | | | $ | (437,954) |  |  | | | $ | (195,315) |  |  | | | $ | (15,216) |  |  | | | $ | (242,639) |  |  | | | (124) | | % |\n| Effective tax rate | | |  | | | 14 | | % |  | | | 9 | | % |  | | | 1 | | % |  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |\n\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had a California research and development ("R&D") credit carryforward of $250 million, which can be carried forward indefinitely. On June 29, 2020, California enacted legislative changes that impose an annual cap of $5 million on the amount of business incentive tax credits we can utilize in California effective for tax years 2020 through 2022. As a result, we evaluated our ability to realize the California R&D credit, and considered all available positive and negative evidence, including operating results, ongoing tax planning, and forecasts of future taxable income and determined it is more likely than not that the pre-2020 credits and a portion of the current year R&D credit would not be realized. In the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 we recorded a valuation allowance of $250 million. We will monitor our business strategies, weighing positive and negative evidence in assessing the realization of this asset in the future and in the event there is a need to release the valuation allowance, a tax benefit will be recorded.\n\nThe increase in our effective tax rate for the year ended December\xa031, 2020 as compared to the year ended December\xa031, 2019 is primarily due to the establishment of a valuation allowance on the California R&D credit, partially offset by the recognition of excess tax benefits of stock-based compensation.\n\nIn 2020, the difference between our 14% effective tax rate and the Federal statutory rate of 21% was primarily due to the recognition of excess tax benefits of stock-based compensation and Federal and California R&D credits, partially offset by the establishment of a valuation allowance on the California R&D credit.\n\n26', 'Table of Contents\n\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|  | | | Year Ended December\xa031, | | | | | | | | |  | | | Change | | | | | |\n|  | | | 2020 | | |  | | | 2019 | | |  | | | 2020 vs. 2019 | | | | | |\n|  | | | (in thousands) | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |\n| Cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash | | | $ | 8,238,870 |  |  | | | $ | 5,043,786 |  |  | | | $ | 3,195,084 |  | 63 | | % |\n| Short-term and long-term debt | | | 16,308,973 | |  |  | | | 14,759,260 | |  |  | | | 1,549,713 | |  | 10 | | % |\n\nCash, cash equivalents and restricted cash increased $3,195 million in the year ended December\xa031, 2020 primarily due to cash provided by operations coupled with the issuance of debt.\n\nDebt, net of debt issuance costs, increased $1,550 million primarily due to the issuance of debt in April 2020 coupled with the remeasurement of our euro-denominated notes. The amount of principal and interest due in the next twelve months is $1,264 million. As of\xa0December\xa031, 2020, no amounts had been borrowed under our $750 million Revolving Credit Agreement. See Note 6 Debt in the accompanying notes to our consolidated financial statements.\n\nAs our cash provided by operating activities improved in 2020, we anticipate that our future capital needs from the debt market will be more limited compared to prior years. Our ability to obtain this or any additional financing that we may choose to, or need to, obtain will depend on, among other things, our development efforts, business plans, operating performance and the condition of the capital markets at the time we seek financing. We may not be able to obtain such financing on terms acceptable to us or at all. If we raise additional funds through the issuance of equity or debt securities, those securities may have rights, preferences or privileges senior to the rights of our common stock, and our stockholders may experience dilution.\n\nAs our cash provided by operating activities grows and exceeds our minimum cash needs, our future capital allocation may include stock repurchase programs. The timing and magnitude of such programs will depend on, among other things, our development efforts, business plans and operating performance.\n\nOur primary uses of cash include the acquisition, licensing and production of content, streaming delivery, marketing programs and personnel-related costs. Cash payment terms for non-original content have historically been in line with the amortization period. Investments in original content, and in particular content that we produce and own, require more cash upfront relative to licensed content. For example, production costs are paid as the content is created, well in advance of when the content is available on the service and amortized. We expect to continue to significantly increase our investments in global content, particularly in original content, which will impact our liquidity. We currently anticipate that cash flows from operations, available funds and access to financing sources, including our revolving credit facility, will continue to be sufficient to meet our cash needs for at least the next twelve months.\n\nFree Cash Flow\n\nWe define free cash flow as cash provided by (used in) operating activities less purchases of property and equipment and change in other assets. We believe free cash flow is an important liquidity metric because it measures, during a given period, the amount of cash generated that is available to repay debt obligations, make strategic acquisitions and investments and for certain other activities like share repurchases. Free cash flow is considered a non-GAAP financial measure and should not be considered in isolation of, or as a substitute for, net income, operating income, cash flow provided by (used in) operating activities, or any other measure of financial performance or liquidity presented in accordance with GAAP.\n\nIn assessing liquidity in relation to our results of operations, we compare free cash flow to net income, noting that the major recurring differences are excess content payments over amortization, non-cash stock-based compensation expense, non-cash remeasurement gain/loss on our euro-denominated debt, and other working capital differences. Working capital differences include deferred revenue, excess property and equipment purchases over depreciation, taxes and semi-annual interest payments on our outstanding debt. Our receivables from members generally settle quickly.\n\n27', 'Table of Contents\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|  | | | Year Ended December\xa031, | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |  | | | Change | | | | | |\n|  | | | 2020 | | |  | | | 2019 | | |  | | | 2018 | | |  | | | 2020 vs. 2019 | | | | | |\n|  | | | (in thousands) | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |\n| Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities | | | $ | 2,427,077 |  |  | | | $ | (2,887,322) |  |  | | | $ | (2,680,479) |  |  | | | $ | 5,314,399 |  | 184 | | % |\n| Net cash used in investing activities | | | (505,354) | |  |  | | | (387,064) | |  |  | | | (339,120) | |  |  | | | (118,290) | |  | (31) | | % |\n| Net cash provided by financing activities | | | 1,237,311 | |  |  | | | 4,505,662 | |  |  | | | 4,048,527 | |  |  | | | (3,268,351) | |  | (73) | | % |\n|  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |\n| Non-GAAP reconciliation of free cash flow: | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |\n| Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities | | | 2,427,077 | |  |  | | | (2,887,322) | |  |  | | | (2,680,479) | |  |  | | | 5,314,399 | |  | 184 | | % |\n| Purchases of property and equipment | | | (497,923) | |  |  | | | (253,035) | |  |  | | | (173,946) | |  |  | | | (244,888) | |  | (97) | | % |\n| Change in other assets | | | (7,431) | |  |  | | | (134,029) | |  |  | | | (165,174) | |  |  | | | 126,598 | |  | 94 | | % |\n| Free cash flow | | | $ | 1,921,723 |  |  | | | $ | (3,274,386) |  |  | | | $ | (3,019,599) |  |  | | | $ | 5,196,109 |  | 159 | | % |\n\nWhile we and our partners have resumed productions and related operations in many parts of the world, our ability to produce content remains affected by the pandemic. As a result, the timing of certain production payments has been and will continue to be delayed until productions can resume and may be shifted to future years. Net cash provided by operating activities increased $5,314 million from the year ended December\xa031, 2019 to $2,427 million for the year ended December\xa031, 2020 primarily driven by a $4,840 million or 24% increase in revenues coupled with a decrease in cash payments for content assets. The payments for content assets decreased $2,074 million, from $14,611 million to $12,537 million, or 14%, as compared to the increase in the amortization of content assets of $1,591 million, from $9,216 million to $10,807 million, or 17%. In addition, we had increased payments associated with higher operating expenses, primarily related to increased headcount to support our continued improvements in our streaming service and our international expansion.\n\nNet cash used in investing activities increased $118 million, primarily due to an increase in purchases of property and equipment.\n\nNet cash provided by financing activities decreased $3,268 million primarily due to a decrease in the proceeds from the issuance of debt of $3,431 million from $4,433 million in the year ended December\xa031, 2019 to $1,002 million in the year ended December\xa031, 2020, partially offset by an increase in the proceeds from the issuance of common stock of $163 million.\n\nFree cash flow was $840 million lower than net income for the year ended December\xa031, 2020 primarily due to $1,730 million of cash payments for content assets over amortization expense and $308\xa0million in other non-favorable working capital differences, partially offset by $533 million of non-cash remeasurement loss on our euro-denominated debt, $415 million of non-cash stock-based compensation expenses, and a $250 million non-cash valuation allowance for deferred taxes due to recent legislation which imposed an annual cap on research and development credits.\n\nFree cash flow was $5,141\xa0million lower than net income for the year ended December 31, 2019 primarily due to $5,394\xa0million of cash payments for streaming content assets over streaming amortization expense, $46\xa0million non-cash remeasurement gain on our euro-denominated debt, and $106\xa0million in other non-favorable working capital differences, partially offset by $405\xa0million of non-cash stock-based compensation expense.\n\nContractual Obligations\n\nFor the purpose of this table, contractual obligations for purchases of goods or services are defined as agreements that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. The expected timing of the payment of the obligations discussed below is estimated based on information available to us as of December\xa031, 2020. Timing of payments and actual amounts paid may be different depending on the time of receipt of goods or services or changes to agreed-upon amounts for some obligations.

An obligation for the production of content includes non-cancelable commitments under creative talent and employment agreements and other production related commitments. An obligation for the acquisition and licensing of content is incurred at the time we enter into an agreement to obtain future titles. Once a title becomes available, a content liability is recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Certain agreements include the obligation to license rights for unknown future titles, the ultimate quantity and/or fees for which are not yet determinable as of the reporting date. Traditional film output deals, or certain TV series license agreements where the number of seasons to be aired is unknown, are examples of these types of agreements. The contractual obligations table above does not include any estimated obligation for the unknown future titles, payment for which could range from less than one year to more than five years. However, these unknown obligations are expected to be significant and we believe could include approximately $1 billion to $4 billion over the next three years, with the payments for the vast majority of such amounts expected to occur after the next twelve months. The foregoing range is based on considerable management judgments and the actual amounts may differ. Once we know the title that we will receive and the license fees, we include the amount in the contractual obligations table above.\n\n(2)Debt obligations include our Notes consisting of principal and interest payments. See Note 6 Debt in the accompanying notes to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8, "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further details.\n\n(3)See Note 5 Balance Sheet Components in the accompanying notes to our consolidated financial statements for further details regarding leases. As of December\xa031, 2020, the Company has additional operating leases for real estate that have not yet commenced of $256\xa0million which has been included above. Total lease obligations as of December\xa031, 2020 increased $82\xa0million from $2,757\xa0million as of December\xa031, 2019 to $2,839\xa0million as of December\xa031, 2020 due to growth in facilities to support our growing headcount and growing number of original productions.\n\n(4)Other purchase obligations include all other non-cancelable contractual obligations. These contracts are primarily related to streaming delivery and cloud computing costs, as well as other miscellaneous open purchase orders for which we have not received the related services or goods.\n\nAs of December\xa031, 2020, we had gross unrecognized tax benefits of $140 million, of which $38 million was classified in “Other non-current liabilities” and $54 million as a reduction to deferred tax assets which was classified as "Other non-current assets" in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. At this time, an estimate of the range of reasonably possible adjustments to the balance of unrecognized tax benefits cannot be made.\n\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\n\nWe do not have transactions with unconsolidated entities, such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities, whereby we have financial guarantees, subordinated retained interests, derivative instruments, or other contingent arrangements that expose us to material continuing risks, contingent liabilities, or any other obligation under a variable interest in an unconsolidated entity that provides financing, liquidity, market risk, or credit risk support to us.\n\n29', 'Table of Contents\n\nIndemnifications\n\nThe information set forth under Note 8 Guarantees - Indemnification Obligations in the accompanying notes to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8, "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K is incorporated herein by reference.\n\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\n\nThe preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported periods. The Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") has defined a company’s critical accounting policies as the ones that are most important to the portrayal of a company’s financial condition and results of operations, and which require a company to make its most difficult and subjective judgments. Based on this definition, we have identified the critical accounting policies and judgments addressed below. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates.\n\nContent\n\nWe acquire, license and produce content, including original programming, in order to offer our members unlimited viewing of video entertainment. The content licenses are for a fixed fee and specific windows of availability. Payment terms for certain content licenses and the production of content require more upfront cash payments relative to the amortization expense. Payments for content, including additions to content assets and the changes in related liabilities, are classified within "Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities" on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.\n\nWe recognize content assets (licensed and produced) as "Content assets, net" on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. For licensed content, we capitalize the fee per title and record a corresponding liability at the gross amount of the liability when the license period begins, the cost of the title is known and the title is accepted and available for streaming. For produced content, we capitalize costs associated with the production, including development cost, direct costs and production overhead. Participations and residuals are expensed in line with the amortization of production costs.\n\nBased on factors including historical and estimated viewing patterns, we amortize the content assets (licensed and produced) in “Cost of revenues” on the Consolidated Statements of Operations over the shorter of each title\'s contractual window of availability or estimated period of use or ten years, beginning with the month of first availability. The amortization is on an accelerated basis, as we typically expect more upfront viewing, for instance due to additional merchandising and marketing efforts, and film amortization is more accelerated than TV series amortization. On average, over 90% of a licensed or produced content asset is expected to be amortized within four years after its month of first availability. We review factors that impact the amortization of the content assets on a regular basis. Our estimates related to these factors require considerable management judgment.\n\nOur business model is subscription based as opposed to a model generating revenues at a specific title level. Content assets (licensed and produced) are predominantly monetized as a group and therefore are reviewed at a group level when an event or change in circumstances indicates a change in the expected usefulness of the content or that the fair value may be less than unamortized cost. To date, we have not identified any such event or changes in circumstances. If such changes are identified in the future, these aggregated content assets will be stated at the lower of unamortized cost or fair value. In addition, unamortized costs for assets that have been, or are expected to be, abandoned are written off.\n\nIncome Taxes\n\nWe record a provision for income taxes for the anticipated tax consequences of our reported results of operations using the asset and liability method. Deferred income taxes are recognized by applying enacted statutory tax rates applicable to future years to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases as well as net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. The measurement of deferred tax assets is reduced, if necessary, by a valuation allowance for any tax benefits for which future realization is uncertain.\n\nAlthough we believe our assumptions, judgments and estimates are reasonable, changes in tax laws or our interpretation of tax laws and the resolution of any tax audits could significantly impact the amounts provided for income taxes in our consolidated financial statements.\n\nIn evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets, in full or in part, we consider all available positive and negative evidence, including our past operating results, and our forecast of future earnings, future taxable income and prudent\n\n30', 'Table of Contents\n\nand feasible tax planning strategies. The assumptions utilized in determining future taxable income require significant judgment and are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying businesses. Actual operating results in future years could differ from our current assumptions, judgments and estimates. However, we believe that it is more likely than not that most of the deferred tax assets recorded on our Consolidated Balance Sheets will ultimately be realized. We record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the net amount that we believe is more likely than not to be realized. As of December\xa031, 2020 the valuation allowance of $250\xa0million was related to the California research and development credits that we do not expect to realize.\n\nWe did not recognize certain tax benefits from uncertain tax positions within the provision for income taxes. We may recognize a tax benefit only if it is more likely than not the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such positions are then measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon settlement. At December\xa031, 2020, our estimated gross unrecognized tax benefits were $140 million of which $86 million, if recognized, would favorably impact our future earnings. Due to uncertainties in any tax audit outcome, our estimates of the ultimate settlement of our unrecognized tax positions may change and the actual tax benefits may differ significantly from the estimates.\n\nSee Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements for further information regarding income taxes.\n\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\n\nThe information set forth under Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements under the caption “Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” is incorporated herein by reference.\n\nItem 7A.Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk\n\nWe are exposed to market risks related to interest rate changes and the corresponding changes in the market values of our debt and foreign currency fluctuations.\n\nInterest Rate Risk\n\nAt December\xa031, 2020, our cash equivalents were generally invested in money market funds. Interest paid on such funds fluctuates with the prevailing interest rate.\n\nAs of December\xa031, 2020, we had $16.4 billion of debt, consisting of fixed rate unsecured debt in sixteen tranches due between 2021 and 2030. Refer to Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements for details about all issuances. The fair value of our debt will fluctuate with movements of interest rates, increasing in periods of declining rates of interest and declining in periods of increasing rates of interest. The fair value of our debt will also fluctuate based on changes in foreign currency rates, as discussed below.\n\nForeign Currency Risk\n\nRevenues denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar account for 54% of the consolidated amount for the year ended December\xa031, 2020. We therefore have foreign currency risk related to these currencies, which are primarily the euro, the British pound, the Brazilian real, the Canadian dollar, the Mexican peso, the Australian dollar, and the Japanese yen.\n\nAccordingly, changes in exchange rates, and in particular a weakening of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar may negatively affect our revenue and operating income as expressed in U.S. dollars. For the year ended December\xa031, 2020, our revenues would have been approximately $596 million higher had foreign currency exchange rates remained constant with those for the year ended December\xa031, 2019.\n\nWe have also experienced and will continue to experience fluctuations in our net income as a result of gains (losses) on the settlement and the remeasurement of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies that are not the functional currency. In the year ended December\xa031, 2020, we recognized a $660\xa0million foreign exchange loss primarily due to the non-cash remeasurement of our Senior Notes denominated in euros, coupled with the remeasurement of cash and content liability positions denominated in currencies other than functional currencies.\n\nIn addition, the effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents in the year ended December\xa031, 2020 was an increase of $36 million.\n\nWe do not use foreign exchange contracts or derivatives to hedge any foreign currency exposures. The volatility of exchange rates depends on many factors that we cannot forecast with reliable accuracy. Our continued international expansion increases our exposure to exchange rate fluctuations and as a result such fluctuations could have a significant impact on our future results of operations.\n\n31', 'Table of Contents\n\nItem 8.Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\n\nThe consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes listed in Part IV, Item\xa015(a)(1) of this Annual Report on Form 10-K are included immediately following Part IV hereof and incorporated by reference herein.\n\nItem 9.Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure\n\nNone.\n\n32', 'Table of Contents\n\nItem 9A.Controls and Procedures\n\n(a)Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\n\nOur management, with the participation of our co-Chief Executive Officers and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Based on that evaluation, our co-Chief Executive Officers and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K were effective in providing reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission’s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our co-Chief Executive Officers and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures.\n\nOur management, including our co-Chief Executive Officers and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal controls will prevent all error and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within Netflix have been detected.\n\n(b)Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\n\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) of the Exchange Act. Our management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December\xa031, 2020. In making this assessment, our management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (“COSO”) in Internal Control—Integrated Framework (2013 framework). Based on our assessment under the framework in Internal Control—Integrated Framework (2013 framework), our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December\xa031, 2020. The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December\xa031, 2020 has been audited by Ernst & Young LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report that is included herein.\n\n(c)Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\n\nThere was no change in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended December\xa031, 2020 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\n\n33', 'Table of Contents\n\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\n\nTo the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of Netflix, Inc.\n\nOpinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\n\nWe have audited Netflix, Inc.’s internal control over financial reporting as of December\xa031, 2020, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). In our opinion, Netflix, Inc.

Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\n\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.\n\nOur audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\n\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\n\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\n\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|  | | | /s/ Ernst & Young LLP | | |\n| San Jose, California | | |  | | |\n| January 28, 2021 | | |  | | |\n\n34', 'Table of Contents\n\nItem 9B.Other Information\n\nNone.\n\n35', 'Table of Contents\n\nPART III\n\nItem 10.Directors, Executive Officers and Corporate Governance\n\nInformation regarding our directors and executive officers is incorporated by reference from the information contained under the sections “Proposal One: Election of Directors,” “Delinquent Section 16(a) Reports” and “Code of Ethics” in our Proxy Statement for the Annual Meeting of Stockholders.\n\nItem 11.Executive Compensation\n\nInformation required by this item is incorporated by reference from information contained under the section “Compensation of Executive Officers and Other Matters” in our Proxy Statement for the Annual Meeting of Stockholders.\n\nItem 12.Security Ownership of Certain Beneficial Owners and Management and Related Stockholder Matters\n\nInformation required by this item is incorporated by reference from information contained under the sections “Security Ownership of Certain Beneficial Owners and Management” and “Equity Compensation Plan Information” in our Proxy Statement for the Annual Meeting of Stockholders.\n\nItem 13.Certain Relationships and Related Transactions, and Director Independence\n\nInformation required by this item is incorporated by reference from information contained under the section “Certain Relationships and Related Transactions” and “Director Independence” in our Proxy Statement for the Annual Meeting of Stockholders.\n\nItem 14.Principal Accounting Fees and Services\n\nInformation with respect to principal independent registered public accounting firm fees and services is incorporated by reference from the information under the caption “Proposal Two: Ratification of Appointment of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm” in our Proxy Statement for the Annual Meeting of Stockholders.\n\n36', 'Table of Contents\n\nPART IV\n\nItem 15.Exhibits, Financial Statement Schedules\n\n(a)The following documents are filed as part of this Annual Report on Form 10-K:\n\n(1)Financial Statements:\n\nThe financial statements are filed as part of this Annual Report on Form 10-K under “Item 8.

We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\n\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\n\nCritical Audit Matter\n\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective or complex judgments. The communication of the critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\n\n40', "Table of Contents\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|  | | | Content Amortization | | |\n| Description of the Matter | | | As disclosed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements “Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies”, the Company acquires, licenses and produces content, including original programming (“Content”). The Company amortizes Content based on factors including historical and estimated viewing patterns.  Auditing the amortization of the Company’s Content is complex and subjective due to the judgmental nature of amortization which is based on an estimate of future viewing patterns. Estimated viewing patterns are based on historical and forecasted viewing. If actual viewing patterns differ from these estimates, the pattern and/or period of amortization would be changed and could affect the timing of recognition of content amortization. | | |\n|  | | |  | | |\n| How We Addressed the  Matter in Our Audit | | | We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over the content amortization process. For example, we tested controls over management’s review of the content amortization method and the significant assumptions, including the historical and forecasted viewing hour consumption, used to develop estimated viewing patterns. We also tested management’s controls to determine that the data used in the model was complete and accurate.  To test content amortization, our audit procedures included, among others, evaluating the content amortization method, testing the significant assumptions used to develop the estimated viewing patterns and testing the completeness and accuracy of the underlying data. For example, we assessed management’s assumptions by comparing them to current viewing trends and current operating information including comparing previous estimates of viewing patterns to actual results. We also performed sensitivity analyses to evaluate the potential changes in the content amortization recorded that could result from changes in the assumptions. | | |\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- |

of Contents\n\nNETFLIX, INC.\n\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\n1.Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\n\nDescription of Business\n\nNetflix, Inc. (the “Company”) was incorporated on August\xa029, 1997 and began operations on April\xa014, 1998. The Company is one of the world’s leading entertainment services with approximately 204 million paid memberships in over 190 countries enjoying TV series, documentaries and feature films across a wide variety of genres and languages. Members can watch as much as they want, anytime, anywhere, on any internet-connected screen. Members can play, pause and resume watching, all without commercials. Additionally, the Company continues to offer its DVD-by-mail service in the United States ("U.S.").\n\nBasis of Presentation\n\nThe consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. Intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated.\n\nUse of Estimates\n\nThe preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Significant items subject to such estimates and assumptions include the content asset amortization policy and the recognition and measurement of income tax assets and liabilities. The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that the Company believes to be reasonable under the circumstances. On an ongoing basis, the Company evaluates these assumptions, judgments and estimates. Actual results may differ from these estimates.\n\nRecently adopted accounting pronouncements\n\nIn June 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") 2016-13, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326), in order to improve financial reporting of expected credit losses on financial instruments and other commitments to extend credit. ASU 2016-13 requires that an entity measure and recognize expected credit losses for financial assets held at amortized cost and replaces the incurred loss impairment methodology in prior GAAP with a methodology that requires consideration of a broader range of information to estimate credit losses. The Company adopted ASU 2016-13 in the first quarter of 2020 and the impact of the adoption was not material to the Company\'s consolidated financial statements as credit losses are not expected to be significant based on historical collection trends, the financial condition of payment partners, and external market factors.\n\nRecently issued accounting pronouncements not yet adopted\n\nIn December 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019-12, Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes (Topic 740). ASU 2019-12 removes certain exceptions for performing intraperiod tax allocations, recognizing deferred taxes for investments, and calculating income taxes in interim periods. The guidance also simplifies the accounting for franchise taxes, transactions that result in a step-up in the tax basis of goodwill, and the effect of enacted changes in tax laws or rates in interim periods. ASU 2019-12 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2020 and early adoption is permitted. While the Company is continuing to assess the potential impacts of ASU 2019-12, it does not expect ASU 2019-12 to have a material effect, if any, on its financial statements.\n\nCash Equivalents\n\nThe Company considers investments in instruments purchased with an original maturity of 90 days or less to be cash equivalents. The Company also classifies amounts in transit from payment processors for customer credit card and debit card transactions as cash equivalents.\n\nContent\n\nThe Company acquires, licenses and produces content, including original programming, in order to offer members unlimited viewing of video entertainment. The content licenses are for a fixed fee and specific windows of availability.\n\n47', 'Table of Contents\n\nPayment terms for certain content licenses and the production of content require more upfront cash payments relative to the amortization expense. Payments for content, including additions to content assets and the changes in related liabilities, are classified within "Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities" on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.\n\nThe Company recognizes content assets (licensed and produced) as “Content assets, net” on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. For licensed content, the Company capitalizes the fee per title and records a corresponding liability at the gross amount of the liability when the license period begins, the cost of the title is known and the title is accepted and available for streaming. For produced content, the Company capitalizes costs associated with the production, including development costs, direct costs and production overhead. Participations and residuals are expensed in line with the amortization of production costs.\n\nBased on factors including historical and estimated viewing patterns, the Company amortizes the content assets (licensed and produced) in “Cost of revenues” on the Consolidated Statements of Operations over the shorter of each title\'s contractual window of availability or estimated period of use or ten years, beginning with the month of first availability. The amortization is on an accelerated basis, as the Company typically expects more upfront viewing, for instance due to additional merchandising and marketing efforts and film amortization is more accelerated than TV series amortization. On average, over 90% of a licensed or produced content asset is expected to be amortized within four years after its month of first availability. The Company reviews factors impacting the amortization of the content assets on an ongoing basis. The Company\'s estimates related to these factors require considerable management judgment.\n\nThe Company\'s business model is subscription based as opposed to a model generating revenues at a specific title level. Content assets (licensed and produced) are predominantly monetized as a group and therefore are reviewed in aggregate at a group level when an event or change in circumstances indicates a change in the expected usefulness of the content or that the fair value may be less than unamortized cost. To date, the Company has not identified any such event or changes in circumstances. If such changes are identified in the future, these aggregated content assets will be stated at the lower of unamortized cost or fair value. In addition, unamortized costs for assets that have been, or are expected to be, abandoned are written off.\n\nProperty and Equipment\n\nProperty and equipment are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method over the shorter of the estimated useful lives of the respective assets, generally up to 30 years, or the expected lease term for leasehold improvements, if applicable.\n\nTrade Receivables\n\nTrade receivables consist primarily of amounts related to members and payment partners that collect membership fees on the Company\'s behalf. The Company evaluates the need for an allowance for doubtful accounts based on historical collection trends, the financial condition of its payment partners, and external market factors.\n\nMarketing\n\nMarketing expenses consist primarily of advertising expenses and certain payments made to the Company’s partners, including consumer electronics ("CE") manufacturers, multichannel video programming distributors ("MVPDs"), mobile operators and internet service providers ("ISPs"). Advertising expenses include promotional activities such as digital and television advertising. Advertising costs are expensed as incurred. Advertising expenses were $1,447 million, $1,879 million and $1,808 million for the years ended December\xa031, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Marketing expenses also include payroll and related expenses for personnel that support the Company\'s marketing activities.\n\nResearch and Development\n\nResearch and development expenses consist of payroll and related costs incurred in making improvements to our service offerings. Research and development expenses were $1,984 million, $1,673 million and $1,218 million for the years ended December\xa031, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\n\n48', 'Table of Contents\n\nIncome Taxes\n\nThe Company records a provision for income taxes for the anticipated tax consequences of the reported results of operations using the asset and liability method. Deferred income taxes are recognized by applying enacted statutory tax rates applicable to future years to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases as well as net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. The measurement of deferred tax assets is reduced, if necessary, by a valuation allowance for any tax benefits for which future realization is uncertain.\n\nThe Company did not recognize certain tax benefits from uncertain tax positions within the provision for income taxes. The Company may recognize a tax benefit only if it is more likely than not the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such positions are then measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon settlement. The Company recognizes interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions in income tax expense. See Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements for further information regarding income taxes.\n\nForeign Currency\n\nThe functional currency for the Company\'s subsidiaries is determined based on the primary economic environment in which the subsidiary operates. The Company translates the assets and liabilities of its non-U.S. dollar functional currency subsidiaries into U.S. dollars using exchange rates in effect at the end of each period. Revenues and expenses for these subsidiaries are translated using rates that approximate those in effect during the period. Gains and losses from these translations are recognized in cumulative translation adjustment included in "Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)" in Stockholders’ equity on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\n\nThe Company remeasures monetary assets and liabilities that are not denominated in the functional currency at exchange rates in effect at the end of each period. Gains and losses from these remeasurements are recognized in interest and other income (expense). Foreign currency transactions resulted in a loss of $660 million, a gain of $7\xa0million, and a loss of $1\xa0million for the years ended December\xa031, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. These gains and losses were primarily due to the non-cash remeasurement of our Senior Notes denominated in euros and the remeasurement of cash and content liability positions denominated in currencies other than functional currencies.\n\nStock-Based Compensation\n\nThe Company grants fully vested non-qualified stock options to its employees on a monthly basis. As a result of immediate vesting, stock-based compensation expense is fully recognized on the grant date, and no estimate is required for post-vesting option forfeitures. See Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements for further information regarding stock-based compensation.\n\n2.Revenue Recognition\n\nThe Company\'s primary source of revenues is from monthly membership fees. Members are billed in advance of the start of their monthly membership and revenues are recognized ratably over each monthly membership period. Revenues are presented net of the taxes that are collected from members and remitted to governmental authorities. The Company is the principal in all its relationships where partners, including CE manufacturers, MVPDs, mobile operators and ISPs, provide access to the service as the Company retains control over service delivery to its members. Typically, payments made to the partners, such as for marketing, are expensed. However, if there is no distinct service provided in exchange for the payments made to the partners or if the price that the member pays is established by the partners and there is no standalone price for the Netflix service (for instance, in a bundle), these payments are recognized as a reduction of revenues.\n\nThe following tables summarize streaming revenues, paid net membership additions, and ending paid memberships by region for the years December\xa031, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively:\n\n49', 'Table of Contents\n\nUnited States and Canada (UCAN)\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|  | | |  | | | As of/ Year Ended December 31, | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |\n|  | | |  | | | 2020 | | |  | | | 2019 | | |  | | | 2018 | | |\n|  | | |  | | | (in thousands) | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |\n| Revenues | | |  | | | $ | 11,455,396 |  |  | | | $ | 10,051,208 |  |  | | | $ | 8,281,532 |  |\n| Paid net membership additions | | |  | | | 6,274 | |  |  | | | 2,905 | |  |  | | | 6,335 | |  |\n| Paid memberships at end of period | | |  | | | 73,936 | |  |  | | | 67,662 | |  |  | | | 64,757 | |  |\n|  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |\n|  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |\n\nEurope, Middle East, and Africa (EMEA)\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|  | | |  | | | As of/ Year Ended December 31, | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |\n|  | | |  | | | 2020 | | |  | | | 2019 | | |  | | | 2018 | | |\n|  | | |  | | | (in thousands) | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |\n| Revenues | | |  | | | $ | 7,772,252 |  |  | | | $ | 5,543,067 |  |  | | | $ | 3,963,707 |  |\n| Paid net membership additions | | |  | | | 14,920 | |  |  | | | 13,960 | |  |  | | | 11,814 | |  |\n| Paid memberships at end of period | | |  | | | 66,698 | |  |  | | | 51,778 | |  |  | | | 37,818 | |  |\n|  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |\n|  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |\n\nLatin America (LATAM)\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|  | | |  | | | As of/ Year Ended December 31, | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |\n|  | | |  | | | 2020 | | |  | | | 2019 | | |  | | | 2018 | | |\n|  | | |  | | | (in thousands) | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |\n| Revenues | | |  | | | $ | 3,156,727 |  |  | | | $ | 2,795,434 |  |  | | | $ | 2,237,697 |  |\n| Paid net membership additions | | |  | | | 6,120 | |  |  | | | 5,340 | |  |  | | | 6,360 | |  |\n| Paid memberships at end of period | | |  | | | 37,537 | |  |  | | | 31,417 | |  |  | | | 26,077 | |  |\n|  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |\n|  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |\n\nAsia-Pacific (APAC)\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|  | | |  | | | As of/ Year Ended December 31, | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |\n|  | | |  | | | 2020 | | |  | | | 2019 | | |  | | | 2018 | | |\n|  | | |  | | | (in thousands) | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |\n| Revenues | | |  | | | $ | 2,372,300 |  |  | | | $ | 1,469,521 |  |  | | | $ | 945,816 |  |\n| Paid net membership additions | | |  | | | 9,259 | |  |  | | | 5,626 | |  |  | | | 4,106 | |  |\n| Paid memberships at end of period | | |  | | | 25,492 | |  |  | | | 16,233 | |  |  | | | 10,607 | |  |\n|  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |\n|  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |\n\n|  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|  |  |  |\n| A paid membership (also referred to as a paid subscription) is defined as a membership that has the right to receive Netflix service following sign-up and a method of payment being provided, and that is not part of a free trial or certain other promotions that may be offered by the Company to new or rejoining members. A membership is canceled and ceases to be reflected in the above metrics as of the effective cancellation date. Voluntary cancellations generally become effective at the end of the prepaid membership period. Involuntary cancellations, as a result of a failed method of payment, become effective immediately.

As of December 31, 2020, total deferred revenue was $1,118\xa0million, the vast majority of which was related to membership fees billed that are expected to be recognized as revenue within the next month. The remaining deferred revenue balance, which is related to gift cards and other prepaid memberships, will be recognized as revenue over the period of service after redemption, which is expected to occur over the next 12 months. The $193 million increase in deferred revenue as compared to the balance of $925\xa0million for the year ended December\xa031, 2019, is a result of the increase in membership fees billed due to increased memberships.\n\n3.Earnings per Share\n\nBasic earnings per share is computed using the weighted-average number of outstanding shares of common stock during the period. Diluted earnings per share is computed using the weighted-average number of outstanding shares of common stock and, when dilutive, potential common shares outstanding during the period. Potential common shares consist of incremental shares issuable upon the assumed exercise of stock options. The computation of earnings per share is as follows:\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|  | | | Year ended December\xa031, | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |\n|  | | | 2020 | | |  | | | 2019 | | |  | | | 2018 | | |\n|  | | | (in\xa0thousands,\xa0except\xa0per\xa0share\xa0data) | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |\n| Basic earnings per share: | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |\n| Net income | | | $ | 2,761,395 |  |  | | | $ | 1,866,916 |  |  | | | $ | 1,211,242 |  |\n| Shares used in computation: | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |\n| Weighted-average common shares outstanding | | | 440,922 | |  |  | | | 437,799 | |  |  | | | 435,374 | |  |\n| Basic earnings per share | | | $ | 6.26 |  |  | | | $ | 4.26 |  |  | | | $ | 2.78 |  |\n| Diluted earnings per share: | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |\n| Net income | | | $ | 2,761,395 |  |  | | | $ | 1,866,916 |  |  | | | $ | 1,211,242 |  |\n| Shares used in computation: | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |\n| Weighted-average common shares outstanding | | | 440,922 | |  |  | | | 437,799 | |  |  | | | 435,374 | |  |\n| Employee stock options | | | 13,286 | |  |  | | | 13,966 | |  |  | | | 15,870 | |  |\n| Weighted-average number of shares | | | 454,208 | |  |  | | | 451,765 | |  |  | | | 451,244 | |  |\n| Diluted earnings per share | | | $ | 6.08 |  |  | | | $ | 4.13 |  |  | | | $ | 2.68 |  |\n\nEmployee stock options with exercise prices greater than the average market price of the common stock were excluded from the diluted calculation as their inclusion would have been anti-dilutive.

These leases generally have terms which range from 1 year to 15 years, and often include one or more options to renew. These renewal terms can extend the lease term from 1 year to 20 years, and are included in the lease term when it is reasonably certain that the Company will exercise the option. These operating leases are included in "Other non-current assets" on the Company\'s Consolidated Balance Sheets, and represent the Company’s right to use the underlying asset for the lease term. The Company’s obligations to make lease payments are included in "Accrued expenses and other liabilities" and "Other non-current liabilities" on the Company\'s Consolidated Balance Sheets. \xa0Operating lease right-of-use assets and liabilities are recognized at the commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. The Company has entered into various short-term operating leases, primarily for marketing billboards, with an initial term of twelve months or less. These leases are not recorded on the Company\'s Consolidated Balance Sheets. All operating lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. For the year ended December\xa031, 2020, the Company recognized approximately $441 million in total lease costs, which was comprised of $324 million in operating lease costs for right-of-use assets and $117 million in short-term lease costs related to short-term operating leases. For the year ended December\xa031, 2019, the Company recognized approximately $448\xa0million in total lease costs, which was comprised of $218\xa0million in operating lease costs for right-of-use assets and $230\xa0million in short-term lease costs related to short-term operating leases.\n\nPrior to the adoption of ASU 2016-02 in the first quarter of 2019, the Company recognized minimum rental expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term. The Company used the date of initial possession to begin amortization, which is generally when the Company entered the space and began to make improvements in preparation for intended use. For scheduled rent escalation clauses during the lease terms or for rental payments commencing at a date other than the date of initial occupancy, the Company recorded minimum rental expenses on a straight-line basis over the terms of the leases in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Rent expense associated with operating leases was $107 million for the year ended December\xa031, 2018.\n\nBecause the rate implicit in each lease is not readily determinable, the Company uses its incremental borrowing rate to determine the present value of the lease payments. The Company has certain contracts for real estate and marketing which may contain lease and non-lease components which it has elected to treat as a single lease component.\n\nInformation related to the Company\'s operating right-of-use assets and related operating lease liabilities were as follows:\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|  | | | Year ended December 31, | | | | | | | | |\n|  | | | 2020 | | |  | | | 2019 | | |\n|  | | | (in thousands) | | | | | | | | |\n| Cash paid for operating lease liabilities | | | $ | 259,559 |  |  | | | $ | 192,084 |  |\n| Right-of-use assets obtained in exchange for new operating lease obligations (1) | | | 729,942 | |  |  | | | 1,672,462 | |  |\n\n(1) Balance as of December\xa031, 2019 includes $743\xa0million for operating leases existing on January 1, 2019.\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|  | | | As of December 31, | | | | | | | | |\n|  | | | 2020 | | |  | | | 2019 | | |\n|  | | | (in thousands, except lease term and discount rate) | | | | | | | | |\n| Operating lease right-of-use assets, net | | | $ | 2,037,726 |  |  | | | $ | 1,532,285 |  |\n|  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |\n| Current operating lease liabilities | | | $ | 256,222 |  |  | | | $ | 190,622 |  |\n| Non-current operating lease liabilities | | | 1,945,631 | |  |  | | | 1,422,612 | |  |\n| Total operating lease liabilities | | | $ | 2,201,853 |  |  | | | $ | 1,613,234 |  |\n|  | | |  | | |  | | |  | | |\n| Weighted-average remaining lease term | | | 8.9 years | | |  | | | 8.8 years | | |\n| Weighted-average discount rate | | | 3.6 | | % |  | | | 5.0 | | % |\n\n54', "Table of Contents\n\nMaturities of operating lease liabilities as of December\xa031, 2020 were as follows (in thousands):\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| Due in 12 month period ended December 31, | | | | | |\n| 2021 | | | $ | 320,245 |  |\n| 2022 | | | 312,154 | |  |\n| 2023 | | | 300,014 | |  |\n| 2024 | | | 279,037 | |  |\n| 2025 | | | 258,348 | |  |\n| Thereafter | | | 1,100,115 | |  |\n|  | | | 2,569,913 | |  |\n| Less imputed interest | | | (368,060) | |  |\n| Total operating lease liabilities | | | 2,201,853 | |  |\n|  | | |  | | |\n| Current operating lease liabilities | | | 256,222 | |  |\n| Non-current operating lease liabilities | | | 1,945,631 | |  |\n| Total operating lease liabilities | | | $ | 2,201,853 |  |\n\nThe Company has additional operating leases for real estate of $256 million which have not commenced as of December\xa031, 2020, and as such, have not been recognized on the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets.

As of December\xa031, 2020 and December\xa031, 2019, the Company was in compliance with all related covenants.\n\nRevolving Credit\xa0Facility\n\nAs of December\xa031, 2020, the Company has a\xa0$750 million\xa0unsecured revolving credit\xa0facility (“Revolving Credit Agreement”), which matures on March 29, 2024. Revolving loans may be borrowed, repaid and reborrowed until March 29, 2024, at which time all amounts borrowed must be repaid. The Company may use the proceeds of future borrowings under the Revolving Credit Agreement for working capital and general corporate purposes. As of\xa0December\xa031, 2020, no amounts have been borrowed under the Revolving Credit Agreement.\n\nThe borrowings under the Revolving Credit Agreement bear interest, at the Company’s option, of either (i) a floating rate equal to a base rate (the “Alternate Base Rate”) or (ii) a rate equal to an adjusted London interbank offered rate (the “Adjusted LIBO Rate”), plus a margin of\xa00.75%. The Alternate Base Rate is defined as the greatest of (A) the rate of interest published by the Wall Street Journal, from time to time, as the prime rate, (B) the federal funds rate, plus\xa00.500%\xa0and (C) the Adjusted LIBO Rate for a one-month interest period, plus\xa01.00%. The Adjusted LIBO Rate is defined as the London interbank offered rate for deposits in U.S. dollars, for the relevant interest period, adjusted for statutory reserve requirements, but in no event shall the Adjusted LIBO Rate be less than\xa00.00%\xa0per annum. Regulatory authorities that oversee financial markets have announced that after the end of 2021, they would no longer compel banks currently reporting information used to set the LIBO Rate to continue to make rate submissions. As a result, it is possible that beginning in 2022, the LIBO Rate will no longer be available as a reference rate. Under the terms of the Company\'s Revolving Credit Agreement, in the event of the discontinuance of the LIBO Rate, a mutually agreed-upon alternate benchmark rate will be established to replace the LIBO Rate. The Company and Lenders shall in good faith establish an alternate benchmark rate which places the Lenders and the Company in the same economic position that existed immediately prior to the discontinuation of the LIBO Rate. The Company does not anticipate that the discontinuance of the LIBO Rate will materially impact its liquidity or financial position.\n\nThe Company is also obligated to pay a commitment fee on the undrawn amounts of the Revolving Credit Agreement at an annual rate of\xa00.10%. The Revolving Credit Agreement requires the Company to comply with certain covenants, including covenants that limit or restrict the ability of the Company’s subsidiaries to incur debt and limit or restrict the ability of the Company and its subsidiaries to grant liens and enter into sale and leaseback transactions; and, in the case of the Company or a guarantor, merge, consolidate, liquidate, dissolve or sell, transfer, lease or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole. As of\xa0December\xa031, 2020 and December\xa031, 2019, the Company was in compliance with all related covenants.\n\n7.Commitments and Contingencies\n\nContent\n\nAt December\xa031, 2020, the Company had $19.2 billion of obligations comprised of $4.4 billion included in "Current content liabilities" and $2.6 billion of "Non-current content liabilities" on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and $12.2 billion of obligations that are not reflected on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as they did not yet meet the criteria for asset recognition.\n\nAt December\xa031, 2019, the Company had $19.5 billion of obligations comprised of $4.4 billion included in "Current content liabilities" and $3.3 billion of "Non-current content liabilities" on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and $11.8 billion of obligations that are not reflected on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as they did not yet meet the criteria for asset recognition.\n\nThe expected timing of payments for these content obligations is as follows:\n\n57', "Table of Contents\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|  | | | As of December 31, | | | | | | | | |\n|  | | | 2020 | | |  | | | 2019 | | |\n|  | | | (in\xa0thousands) | | | | | | | | |\n| Less than one year | | | $ | 8,980,868 |  |  | | | $ | 8,477,367 |  |\n| Due after one year and through 3 years | | | 7,819,563 | |  |  | | | 8,352,731 | |  |\n| Due after 3 years and through 5 years | | | 1,973,091 | |  |  | | | 2,041,340 | |  |\n| Due after 5 years | | | 445,308 | |  |  | | | 618,644 | |  |\n| Total content obligations | | | $ | 19,218,830 |  |  | | | $ | 19,490,082 |  |\n\nContent obligations include amounts related to the acquisition, licensing and production of content. Obligations that are in non-U.S. dollar currencies are translated to the U.S. dollar at period end rates. An obligation for the production of content includes non-cancelable commitments under creative talent and employment agreements as well as other production related commitments. An obligation for the acquisition and licensing of content is incurred at the time the Company enters into an agreement to obtain future titles. Once a title becomes available, a content liability is recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Certain agreements include the obligation to license rights for unknown future titles, the ultimate quantity and/or fees for which are not yet determinable as of the reporting date. Traditional film output deals, or certain TV series license agreements where the number of seasons to be aired is unknown, are examples of such license agreements. The Company does not include any estimated obligation for these future titles beyond the known minimum amount. However, the unknown obligations are expected to be significant.\n\nLegal Proceedings\n\nFrom time to time, in the normal course of its operations, the Company is subject to litigation matters and claims, including claims relating to employee relations, business practices and patent infringement. Litigation can be expensive and disruptive to normal business operations. Moreover, the results of complex legal proceedings are difficult to predict and the Company's view of these matters may change in the future as the litigation and events related thereto unfold. The Company expenses legal fees as incurred. The Company records a provision for contingent losses when it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. An unfavorable outcome to any legal matter, if material, could have an adverse effect on the Company's operations or its financial position, liquidity or results of operations.\n\nThe Company is involved in litigation matters not listed herein but does not consider the matters to be material either individually or in the aggregate at this time. The Company's view of the matters not listed may change in the future as the litigation and events related thereto unfold.\n\n8.Guarantees—Indemnification Obligations\n\nIn the ordinary course of business, the Company has entered into contractual arrangements under which it has agreed to provide indemnification of varying scope and terms to business partners and other parties with respect to certain matters, including, but not limited to, losses arising out of the Company’s breach of such agreements and out of intellectual property infringement claims made by third parties. In these circumstances, payment may be conditional on the other party making a claim pursuant to the procedures specified in the particular contract.\n\nThe Company’s obligations under these agreements may be limited in terms of time or amount, and in some instances, the Company may have recourse against third parties for certain payments. In addition, the Company has entered into indemnification agreements with its directors and certain of its officers that will require it, among other things, to indemnify them against certain liabilities that may arise by reason of their status or service as directors or officers. The terms of such obligations vary.\n\nIt is not possible to make a reasonable estimate of the maximum potential amount of future payments under these or similar agreements due to the conditional nature of the Company’s obligations and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular agreement. No amount has been accrued in the accompanying consolidated financial statements with respect to these indemnification guarantees.\n\n58", "Table of Contents\n\n9.

The 2020 Stock Plan is the successor to the 2011 Stock Plan. The 2020 Stock Plan provides for the grant of incentive stock options to employees and for the grant of non-statutory stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock and restricted stock units to employees, directors and consultants. The 2020 Stock Plan authorized 17,500,000 new shares to be available for award grants. As of the date the 2020 Stock Plan was adopted by the Company's Board of Directors, 5,530,106 shares were available to be granted under the 2011 Stock Plan.

This amount changes based on the fair market value of the Company’s common stock. Total intrinsic value of options exercised for the years ended December\xa031, 2020, 2019 and 2018 was $1,596 million, $666 million and $863 million, respectively. The weighted-average remaining contractual term of the Company's outstanding stock options as of December\xa031, 2020 included in the table above was 5.55 years.\n\nCash received from option exercises for the years ended December\xa031, 2020, 2019 and 2018 was $235 million, $72 million and $125 million, respectively.\n\n59", 'Table of Contents\n\nStock-Based Compensation\n\nStock options granted are exercisable for the full ten year contractual term regardless of employment status.

The Company believes that implied volatility of publicly traded options in its common stock is more reflective of market conditions, and given consistently high trade volumes of the options, can reasonably be expected to be a better indicator of expected volatility than historical volatility of its common stock.\n\nIn valuing shares issued under the Company’s employee stock option plans, the Company bases the risk-free interest rate on U.S. Treasury zero-coupon issues with terms similar to the contractual term of the options. The Company does not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future and therefore uses an expected dividend yield of\xa0zero\xa0in the option valuation model.

As a result, we evaluated the Company\'s ability to realize the California R&D credit, the Company considered all available positive and negative evidence, including operating results, ongoing tax planning, and forecasts of future taxable income and determined it is more likely than not that the pre-2020 credits and a portion of the current year R&D credit would not be realized. In the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, the Company has recorded a valuation allowance of $250\xa0million.

As of December\xa031, 2020, the valuation allowance of $250 million was related to the California R&D credits that the Company does not expect to realize.\n\nAs of December\xa031, 2020, the Company\'s Federal R&D tax credit and state tax credit carryforwards for tax return purposes were $317 million, and $365 million, respectively. The Federal R&D tax credit carryforwards expire through 2040. State tax credit carryforwards can be carried forward indefinitely.\n\nIn the fourth quarter of 2020, the Company determined that the likelihood of utilizing its non-U.S. foreign tax credits of $135\xa0million for which there was a valuation allowance of $135\xa0million was remote given its recent global corporate simplification. As such, the Company has written off the deferred tax asset against the valuation allowance and will no longer disclose these amounts.\n\nThe unrecognized tax benefits that are not expected to result in payment or receipt of cash within one year are classified as “Other non-current liabilities” and a reduction of deferred tax assets which is classified as "Other non-current assets" in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

The years 2014 through 2019 generally remain subject to examination by foreign tax authorities.\n\nGiven the potential outcome of the current examinations as well as the impact of the current examinations on the potential expiration of the statute of limitations, it is reasonably possible that the balance of unrecognized tax benefits could significantly change within the next twelve months. However, an estimate of the range of reasonably possible adjustments cannot be made at this time.\n\n11.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Employee Benefit Plan\n\nThe Company maintains a 401(k) savings plan covering substantially all of its employees. Eligible employees may contribute up to 80% of their annual salary through payroll deductions, but not more than the statutory limits set by the Internal Revenue Service. The Company matches employee contributions at the discretion of the Board. During 2020, 2019 and 2018, the Company’s matching contributions totaled $69 million, $47 million and $27 million, respectively.\n\nMultiemployer Benefit Plans\n\nThe Company contributes to various multiemployer defined pension plans under the terms of collective bargaining agreements that cover our union-represented employees. The risks of participating in multiemployer pension plans are different from single-employer plans such that (i) contributions made by the Company to the multiemployer pension plans may be used to provide benefits to employees of other participating employers; (ii) if the Company chooses to stop participating in the multiemployer pension plans, it may be required to pay those plans an amount based on the underfunded status of the plan; and (iii) if the Company stops contributing to the multiemployer pension plan, the unfunded obligations of the plan may become the obligation of the remaining participating employers. The Company also contributes to various other multiemployer benefit plans that provide health and welfare benefits to both active and retired participants. The Company does not participate in any multiemployer benefit plans that are individually significant to the Company.\n\nThe following table summarizes the Company's contributions to multiemployer pension and health plans for the years ended December\xa031, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively:\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|  | | | Year Ended December\xa031, | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |\n|  | | | 2020 | | |  | | | 2019 | | |  | | | 2018 | | |\n|  | | | (in thousands) | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |\n| Pension benefits | | | $ | 78,060 |  |  | | | $ | 89,703 |  |  | | | $ | 32,389 |  |\n| Health benefits | | | 52,322 | |  |  | | | 44,351 | |  |  | | | 26,898 | |  |\n| Total contributions | | | $ | 130,382 |  |  | | | $ | 134,054 |  |  | | | $ | 59,287 |  |\n\n63", 'Table of Contents\n\n12.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Segment and Geographic Information\n\nThe Company operates as one operating segment. The Company\'s chief operating decision maker ("CODM") is its co-chief executive officers, who review financial information presented on a consolidated basis for purposes of making operating decisions, assessing financial performance and allocating resources.\n\nOn July 13, 2020, Ted Sarandos was appointed as co-Chief Executive Officer of the Company and serves as Chief Content Officer with Reed Hastings, the Company’s President, co-Chief Executive Officer, and Chairman of the Board. The Company determined that both Mr. Sarandos and Mr. Hastings are its CODM and that there have been no changes to the Company\'s one operating segment as the Company\'s financial results continue to be evaluated on a consolidated basis by its CODM.\n\nTotal U.S. revenues were $10.8 billion, $9.5 billion and $8.0 billion for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.

(“Netflix”, “the Company”, “we”, or “us”) is the world’s leading subscription streaming entertainment service with over 167 million paid streaming memberships in over 190 countries enjoying TV series, documentaries and feature films across a wide variety of genres and languages. Members can watch as much as they want, anytime, anywhere, on any internet-connected screen. Members can play, pause and resume watching, all without commercials. Additionally, over two million members in the United States ("U.S.") subscribe to our legacy DVD-by-mail service.\n\nWe are a pioneer in the delivery of streaming entertainment, launching our streaming service in 2007. Since this launch, we have developed an ecosystem for internet-connected screens and have added increasing amounts of content that enable consumers to enjoy entertainment directly on their internet-connected screens. As a result of these efforts, we have experienced growing consumer acceptance of, and interest in, the delivery of streaming entertainment.\n\nOur core strategy is to grow our streaming membership business globally within the parameters of our operating margin target. We are continuously improving our members\' experience by expanding our streaming content with a focus on a programming mix of content that delights our members and attracts new members. In addition, we are continuously enhancing our user interface and extending our streaming service to more internet-connected screens. Our members can download a selection of titles for offline viewing.\n\nBUSINESS SEGMENTS\n\nEffective in the fourth quarter of 2019, we operate our business as one global operating segment. Our revenues are primarily derived from monthly membership fees for services related to streaming content to our members. See Note 10, Segment and Geographic Information, in the accompanying notes to our consolidated financial statements for further detail.\n\nCOMPETITION\n\nThe market for streaming entertainment is intensely competitive and subject to rapid change. We compete against other entertainment video providers, such as multichannel video programming distributors ("MVPDs"), streaming entertainment providers (including those that provide pirated content), video gaming providers and more broadly against other sources of entertainment that our members could choose in their moments of free time. We also compete against streaming entertainment providers and content producers in obtaining content for our service, both for licensed streaming content and for original content projects.\n\nWhile consumers may maintain simultaneous relationships with multiple entertainment sources, we strive for consumers to choose us in their moments of free time. We have often referred to this choice as our objective of "winning moments of truth." In attempting to win these moments of truth with our members, we are continually improving our service, including both our technology and our content, which is increasingly exclusive and curated, and includes our own original programming.\n\n1', 'Table of Contents\n\nSEASONALITY\n\nOur membership growth exhibits a seasonal pattern that reflects variations when consumers buy internet-connected screens and when they tend to increase their viewing. Historically, the first and fourth quarters (October through March) represent our greatest streaming membership growth. In addition, our membership growth can be impacted by our content release schedule and changes to pricing.\n\nINTELLECTUAL PROPERTY\n\nWe regard our trademarks, service marks, copyrights, patents, domain names, trade dress, trade secrets, proprietary technologies and similar intellectual property as important to our success. We use a combination of patent, trademark, copyright and trade secret laws and confidentiality agreements to protect our proprietary intellectual property. Our ability to protect and enforce our intellectual property rights is subject to certain risks and from time to time we encounter disputes over rights and obligations concerning intellectual property. We cannot provide assurance that we will prevail in any intellectual property disputes.\n\nEMPLOYEES\n\nAs of December\xa031, 2019, we had approximately 8,600 full-time employees.\n\nOTHER INFORMATION\n\nWe were incorporated in Delaware in August 1997 and completed our initial public offering in May 2002. Our principal executive offices are located at 100 Winchester Circle, Los Gatos, California 95032, and our telephone number is (408)\xa0540-3700.\n\nWe maintain a website at www.netflix.com. The contents of our website are not incorporated in, or otherwise to be regarded as part of, this Annual Report on Form 10-K. In this Annual Report on Form 10-K, “Netflix,” the “Company,” “we,” “us,” “our” and the “registrant” refer to Netflix, Inc. We make available, free of charge on our website, access to our Annual Report on Form 10-K, our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, our Current Reports on Form 8-K and amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), as soon as reasonably practicable after we file or furnish them electronically with the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC").\n\nInvestors and others should note that we announce material financial information to our investors using our investor relations website (http://ir.netflix.com), SEC filings, press releases, public conference calls and webcasts. We use these channels as well as social media to communicate with our members and the public about our company, our services and other issues. It is possible that the information we post on social media could be deemed to be material information. Therefore, we encourage investors, the media, and others interested in our company to review the information we post on the social media channels listed on our investor relations website.\n\n2', 'Table of Contents\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  |  |\n| Item 1A. | Risk Factors |\n\nIf any of the following risks actually occur, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be harmed. In that case, the trading price of our common stock could decline, and you could lose all or part of your investment.\n\nRisks Related to Our Business\n\nIf our efforts to attract and retain members are not successful, our business will be adversely affected.\n\nWe have experienced significant membership growth over the past several years. Our ability to continue to attract members will depend in part on our ability to consistently provide our members with compelling content choices, effectively market our service, as well as provide a quality experience for selecting and viewing TV series and movies. Furthermore, the relative service levels, content offerings, pricing and related features of competitors to our service may adversely impact our ability to attract and retain memberships. Competitors include other entertainment video providers, such as MVPDs, and streaming entertainment providers (including those that provide pirated content), as well as video gaming providers and more broadly other sources of entertainment that our members could choose in their moments of free time. If consumers do not perceive our service offering to be of value, including if we introduce new or adjust existing features, adjust pricing or service offerings, or change the mix of content in a manner that is not favorably received by them, we may not be able to attract and retain members. In addition, many of our members rejoin our service or originate from word-of-mouth advertising from existing members. If our efforts to satisfy our existing members are not successful, we may not be able to attract members, and as a result, our ability to maintain and/or grow our business will be adversely affected. Members cancel our service for many reasons, including a perception that they do not use the service sufficiently, the need to cut household expenses, availability of content is unsatisfactory, competitive services provide a better value or experience and customer service issues are not satisfactorily resolved. We must continually add new memberships both to replace canceled memberships and to grow our business beyond our current membership base. While we permit multiple users within the same household to share a single account for non-commercial purposes, if account sharing is abused, our ability to add new members may be hindered and our results of operations may be adversely impacted. If we do not grow as expected, given, in particular, that our content costs are largely fixed in nature and contracted over several years, we may not be able to adjust our expenditures or increase our (per membership) revenues commensurate with the lowered growth rate such that our margins, liquidity and results of operation may be adversely impacted. If we are unable to successfully compete with current and new competitors in both retaining our existing memberships and attracting new memberships, our business will be adversely affected. Further, if excessive numbers of members cancel our service, we may be required to incur significantly higher marketing expenditures than we currently anticipate to replace these members with new members.\n\nChanges in competitive offerings for entertainment video, including the potential rapid adoption of piracy-based video offerings, could adversely impact our business.\n\nThe market for entertainment video is intensely competitive and subject to rapid change. Through new and existing distribution channels, consumers have increasing options to access entertainment video. The various economic models underlying these channels include subscription, transactional, ad-supported and piracy-based models. All of these have the potential to capture meaningful segments of the entertainment video market. Piracy, in particular, threatens to damage our business, as its fundamental proposition to consumers is so compelling and difficult to compete against: virtually all content for free. Furthermore, in light of the compelling consumer proposition, piracy services are subject to rapid global growth. Traditional providers of entertainment video, including broadcasters and cable network operators, as well as internet based e-commerce or entertainment video providers are increasing their streaming video offerings. Several of these competitors have long operating histories, large customer bases, strong brand recognition, exclusive rights to certain content and significant financial, marketing and other resources. They may secure better terms from suppliers, adopt more aggressive pricing and devote more resources to product development, technology, infrastructure, content acquisitions and marketing. New entrants may enter the market or existing providers may adjust their services with unique offerings or approaches to providing entertainment video. Companies also may enter into business combinations or alliances that strengthen their competitive positions. If we are unable to successfully or profitably compete with current and new competitors, our business will be adversely affected, and we may not be able to increase or maintain market share, revenues or profitability.\n\nThe long-term and fixed cost nature of our content commitments may limit our operating flexibility and could adversely affect our liquidity and results of operations.\n\nIn connection with licensing streaming content, we typically enter into multi-year commitments with studios and other content providers. We also enter into multi-year commitments for content that we produce, either directly or through third parties, including elements associated with these productions such as non-cancelable commitments under talent agreements.\n\n3', 'Table of Contents\n\nThe payment terms of these agreements are not tied to member usage or the size of our membership base (“fixed cost”) but may be determined by costs of production or tied to such factors as titles licensed and/or theatrical exhibition receipts. Such commitments, to the extent estimable under accounting standards, are included in the Contractual Obligations section of Part II, Item 7, "Management\'s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" and Note 5, Commitments and Contingencies in the accompanying notes to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8, "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Given the multiple-year duration and largely fixed cost nature of content commitments, if membership acquisition and retention do not meet our expectations, our margins may be adversely impacted. Payment terms for certain content commitments, such as content we directly produce, will typically require more up-front cash payments than other content licenses or arrangements whereby we do not cashflow the production of such content. To the extent membership and/or revenue growth do not meet our expectations, our liquidity and results of operations could be adversely affected as a result of content commitments and accelerated payment requirements of certain agreements. In addition, the long-term and fixed cost nature of our content commitments may limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to changes in our business and the market segments in which we operate. If we license and/or produce content that is not favorably received by consumers in a territory, or is unable to be shown in a territory, acquisition and retention may be adversely impacted and given the long-term and fixed cost nature of our content commitments, we may not be able to adjust our content offering quickly and our results of operation may be adversely impacted.\n\nWe face risks, such as unforeseen costs and potential liability in connection with content we acquire, produce, license and/or distribute through our service.\n\nAs a producer and distributor of content, we face potential liability for negligence, copyright and trademark infringement, or other claims based on the nature and content of materials that we acquire, produce, license and/or distribute. We also may face potential liability for content used in promoting our service, including marketing materials. We are devoting more resources toward the development, production, marketing and distribution of original programming, including TV series and movies. We believe that original programming can help differentiate our service from other offerings, enhance our brand and otherwise attract and retain members. To the extent our original programming does not meet our expectations, in particular, in terms of costs, viewing and popularity, our business, including our brand and results of operations may be adversely impacted. As we expand our original programming, we have become responsible for production costs and other expenses, such as ongoing guild payments. We also take on risks associated with production, such as completion and key talent risk. Negotiations or renewals related to entertainment industry collective bargaining agreements could negatively impact timing and costs associated with our productions. We contract with third parties related to the development, production, marketing and distribution of our original programming.\xa0 We may face potential liability or may suffer losses in connection with these arrangements, including but not limited to if such third parties violate applicable law, become insolvent or engage in fraudulent behavior. To the extent we create and sell physical or digital merchandise relating to our original programming, and/or license such rights to third parties, we could become subject to product liability, intellectual property or other claims related to such merchandise. We may decide to remove content from our service, not to place licensed or produced content on our service or discontinue or alter production of original content if we believe such content might not be well received by our members, or could be damaging to our brand or business.\n\nTo the extent we do not accurately anticipate costs or mitigate risks, including for content that we obtain but ultimately does not appear on or is removed from our service, or if we become liable for content we acquire, produce, license and/or distribute, our business may suffer. Litigation to defend these claims could be costly and the expenses and damages arising from any liability or unforeseen production risks could harm our results of operations. We may not be indemnified against claims or costs of these types and we may not have insurance coverage for these types of claims.\n\nIf studios, content providers or other rights holders refuse to license streaming content or other rights upon terms acceptable to us, our business could be adversely affected.\n\nOur ability to provide our members with content they can watch depends on studios, content providers and other rights holders licensing rights, including distribution rights, to such content and certain related elements thereof, such as the public performance of music contained within the content we distribute. The license periods and the terms and conditions of such licenses vary. As content providers develop their own streaming services, they may be unwilling to provide us with access to certain content, including popular series or movies. If the studios, content providers and other rights holders are not or are no longer willing or able to license us content upon terms acceptable to us, our ability to stream content to our members may be adversely affected and/or our costs could increase. Certain licenses for content provide for the studios or other content providers to withdraw content from our service relatively quickly. Because of these provisions as well as other actions we may take, content available through our service can be withdrawn on short notice. As competition increases, we see the cost of certain programming increase. As we seek to differentiate our service, we are increasingly focused on securing certain exclusive rights when obtaining content, including original content. We are also focused on programming an overall mix of content that delights our members in a cost efficient manner. Within this context, we are selective about the titles we add and\n\n4', 'Table of Contents\n\nrenew to our service. If we do not maintain a compelling mix of content, our membership acquisition and retention may be adversely affected.\n\nMusic and certain authors’ performances contained within content we distribute may require us to obtain licenses for such distribution. In this regard, we engage in negotiations with collection management organizations (“CMOs”) that hold certain rights to music and/or other interests in connection with streaming content into various territories. If we are unable to reach mutually acceptable terms with these organizations, we could become involved in litigation and/or could be enjoined from distributing certain content, which could adversely impact our business. Additionally, pending and ongoing litigation as well as negotiations between certain CMOs and other third parties in various territories could adversely impact our negotiations with CMOs, or result in music publishers represented by certain CMOs unilaterally withdrawing rights, and thereby adversely impact our ability to reach licensing agreements reasonably acceptable to us. Failure to reach such licensing agreements could expose us to potential liability for copyright infringement or otherwise increase our costs. Additionally, as the market for the digital distribution of content grows, a broader role for CMOs in the remuneration of authors and performers could expose us to greater distribution expenses.\n\nIf we are not able to manage change and growth, our business could be adversely affected.\n\nWe are expanding our operations internationally, scaling our streaming service to effectively and reliably handle anticipated growth in both members and features related to our service, ramping up our ability to produce original content, as well as continuing to operate our DVD service within the U.S. As our international offering evolves, we are managing and adjusting our business to address varied content offerings, consumer customs and practices, in particular those dealing with e-commerce and streaming video, as well as differing legal and regulatory environments. As we scale our streaming service, we are developing technology and utilizing third-party “cloud” computing services. As we ramp up our original content production, we are building out expertise in a number of disciplines, including creative, marketing, legal, finance, licensing, merchandising and other resources related to the development and physical production of content. Further, we may expand our content offering in a manner that is not well received by consumers. As we grow our operations, we may face integration and operational challenges as well as potential unknown liabilities and reputational concerns in connection with partners we work with or companies we may acquire or control. If we are not able to manage the growing complexity of our business, including improving, refining or revising our systems and operational practices related to our streaming operations and original content, our business may be adversely affected.\n\nWe could be subject to economic, political, regulatory and other risks arising from our international operations.\n\nOperating in international markets requires significant resources and management attention and will subject us to economic, political, regulatory and other risks that may be different from or incremental to those in the U.S. In addition to the risks that we face in the U.S., our international operations involve risks that could adversely affect our business, including:\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  |  |\n| • | the need to adapt our content and user interfaces for specific cultural and language differences; |\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  |  |\n| • | difficulties and costs associated with staffing and managing foreign operations; |\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  |  |\n| • | political or social unrest and economic instability; |\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  |  |\n| • | compliance with laws such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, UK Bribery Act and other anti-corruption laws, export controls and economic sanctions, and local laws prohibiting corrupt payments to government officials; |\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  |  |\n| • | difficulties in understanding and complying with local laws, regulations and customs in foreign jurisdictions, including local ownership requirements for streaming content providers; |\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  |  |\n| • | regulatory requirements or government action against our service, whether in response to enforcement of actual or purported legal and regulatory requirements or otherwise, that results in disruption or non-availability of our service or particular content in the applicable jurisdiction; |\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  |  |\n| • | foreign intellectual property laws, such as the EU copyright directive, or changes to such laws, which may be less favorable than U.S. law and, among other issues, may impact the economics of creating or distributing content, anti-piracy efforts, or our ability to protect or exploit intellectual property rights; |\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  |  |\n| • | adverse tax consequences such as those related to changes in tax laws or tax rates or their interpretations, and the related application of judgment in determining our global provision for income taxes, deferred tax assets or liabilities or other tax liabilities given the ultimate tax determination is uncertain; |\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  |  |\n| • | fluctuations in currency exchange rates, which we do not use foreign exchange contracts or derivatives to hedge against and which will impact revenues and expenses of our international operations and expose us to foreign currency exchange rate risk; |\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  |  |\n| • | profit repatriation and other restrictions on the transfer of funds; |\n\n5', 'Table of Contents\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  |  |\n| • | differing payment processing systems as well as consumer use and acceptance of electronic payment methods, such as payment cards; |\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  |  |\n| • | new and different sources of competition; |\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  |  |\n| • | censorship requirements that cause us to remove or edit popular content, leading to consumer disappointment, brand tarnishment or dissatisfaction with our service; |\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  |  |\n| • | low usage and/or penetration of internet-connected consumer electronic devices; |\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  |  |\n| • | different and more stringent user protection, data protection, privacy and other laws, including data localization and/or restrictions on data export, and local ownership requirements; |\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  |  |\n| • | availability of reliable broadband connectivity and wide area networks in targeted areas for expansion; |\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  |  |\n| • | differing, and often more lenient, laws and consumer understanding/attitudes regarding the illegality of piracy; |\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  |  |\n| • | negative impacts from trade disputes; and |\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  |  |\n| • | implementation of regulations designed to stimulate the local production of film and TV series in order to promote and preserve local culture and economic activity, including local content quotas, investment obligations, and levies to support local film funds. For example, the European Union recently revised its Audio Visual Media Services Directive to require that European works comprise at least thirty (30) percent of media service providers’ catalogs, and to require prominence of those works. |\n\nOur failure to manage any of these risks successfully could harm our international operations and our overall business, and results of our operations.\n\nWe are subject to taxation related risks in multiple jurisdictions.\n\nWe are a U.S.-based multinational company subject to tax in multiple U.S. and foreign tax jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in determining our global provision for income taxes, deferred tax assets or liabilities and in evaluating our tax positions on a worldwide basis. While we believe our tax positions are consistent with the tax laws in the jurisdictions in which we conduct our business, it is possible that these positions may be challenged by jurisdictional tax authorities, which may have a significant impact on our global provision for income taxes.\n\nTax laws are being re-examined and evaluated globally. New laws and interpretations of the law are taken into account for financial statement purposes in the quarter or year that they become applicable. Tax authorities are increasingly scrutinizing the tax positions of companies. Many countries in the European Union, as well as a number of other countries and organizations such as the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, are actively considering changes to existing tax laws that, if enacted, could increase our tax obligations in countries where we do business. If U.S. or other foreign tax authorities change applicable tax laws, our overall taxes could increase, and our business, financial condition or results of operations may be adversely impacted.\n\nIf we fail to maintain or, in newer markets establish, a positive reputation concerning our service, including the content we offer, we may not be able to attract or retain members, and our operating results may be adversely affected.\n\nWe believe that a positive reputation concerning our service is important in attracting and retaining members. To the extent our content, in particular, our original programming, is perceived as low quality, offensive or otherwise not compelling to consumers, our ability to establish and maintain a positive reputation may be adversely impacted. To the extent our content is deemed controversial or offensive by government regulators, we may face direct or indirect retaliatory action or behavior, including being required to remove such content from our service, our entire service could be banned and/or become subject to heightened regulatory scrutiny across our business and operations. We could also face boycotts which could adversely affect our business. Furthermore, to the extent our response to government action or our marketing, customer service and public relations efforts are not effective or result in negative reaction, our ability to establish and maintain a positive reputation may likewise be adversely impacted. With newer markets, we also need to establish our reputation with consumers and to the extent we are not successful in creating positive impressions, our business in these newer markets may be adversely impacted.\n\nChanges in how we market our service could adversely affect our marketing expenses and membership levels may be adversely affected.\n\nWe utilize a broad mix of marketing and public relations programs, including social media sites, to promote our service and content to existing and potential new members. We may limit or discontinue use or support of certain marketing sources or activities if advertising rates increase or if we become concerned that members or potential members deem certain marketing platforms or practices intrusive or damaging to our brand. If the available marketing channels are curtailed, our ability to engage members and attract new members may be adversely affected.\n\n6', "Table of Contents\n\nCompanies that promote our service may decide that we negatively impact their business or may make business decisions that in turn negatively impact us. For example, if they decide that they want to compete more directly with us, enter a similar business or exclusively support our competitors, we may no longer have access to their marketing channels. We also acquire a number of members who rejoin our service having previously canceled their membership. If we are unable to maintain or replace our sources of members with similarly effective sources, or if the cost of our existing sources increases, our member levels and marketing expenses may be adversely affected.\n\nWe utilize marketing to promote our content, drive conversation about our content and service, and drive viewing by our members. To the extent we promote our content inefficiently or ineffectively, we may not obtain the expected acquisition and retention benefits and our business may be adversely affected.\n\nWe rely upon a number of partners to make our service available on their devices.\n\nWe currently offer members the ability to receive streaming content through a host of internet-connected screens, including TVs, digital video players, television set-top boxes and mobile devices. We have agreements with various cable, satellite and telecommunications operators to make our service available through the television set-top boxes of these service providers, some of whom may have investments in competing streaming content providers. In many instances, our agreements also include provisions by which the partner bills consumers directly for the Netflix service or otherwise offers services or products in connection with offering our service. If partners or other providers do a better job of connecting consumers with content they want to watch, for example through multi-service discovery interfaces, our service may be adversely impacted. We intend to continue to broaden our relationships with existing partners and to increase our capability to stream TV series and movies to other platforms and partners over time. If we are not successful in maintaining existing and creating new relationships, or if we encounter technological, content licensing, regulatory, business or other impediments to delivering our streaming content to our members via these devices, our ability to retain members and grow our business could be adversely impacted.\n\nOur agreements with our partners are typically between one and three years in duration and our business could be adversely affected if, upon expiration, a number of our partners do not continue to provide access to our service or are unwilling to do so on terms acceptable to us, which terms may include the degree of accessibility and prominence of our service. Furthermore, devices are manufactured and sold by entities other than Netflix and while these entities should be responsible for the devices’ performance, the connection between these devices and Netflix may nonetheless result in consumer dissatisfaction toward Netflix and such dissatisfaction could result in claims against us or otherwise adversely impact our business. In addition, technology changes to our streaming functionality may require that partners update their devices, or may lead to us to stop supporting the delivery of our service on certain legacy devices. If partners do not update or otherwise modify their devices, or if we discontinue support for certain devices, our service and our members' use and enjoyment could be negatively impacted.\n\nAny significant disruption in or unauthorized access to our computer systems or those of third parties that we utilize in our operations, including those relating to cybersecurity or arising from cyber-attacks, could result in a loss or degradation of service, unauthorized disclosure of data, including member and corporate information, or theft of intellectual property, including digital content assets, which could adversely impact our business.\n\nOur reputation and ability to attract, retain and serve our members is dependent upon the reliable performance and security of our computer systems and those of third parties that we utilize in our operations. These systems may be subject to damage or interruption from, among other things, earthquakes, adverse weather conditions, other natural disasters, terrorist attacks, rogue employees, power loss, telecommunications failures, and cybersecurity risks. Interruptions in these systems, or with the internet in general, could make our service unavailable or degraded or otherwise hinder our ability to deliver our service. Service interruptions, errors in our software or the unavailability of computer systems used in our operations could diminish the overall attractiveness of our membership service to existing and potential members.\n\nOur computer systems and those of third parties we use in our operations are subject to cybersecurity threats, including cyber-attacks such as computer viruses, denial of service attacks, physical or electronic break-ins and similar disruptions. These systems periodically experience directed attacks intended to lead to interruptions and delays in our service and operations as well as loss, misuse or theft of personal information and other data, confidential information or intellectual property. Additionally, outside parties may attempt to induce employees or users to disclose sensitive or confidential information in order to gain access to data. Any attempt by hackers to obtain our data (including member and corporate information) or intellectual property (including digital content assets), disrupt our service, or otherwise access our systems, or those of third parties we use, if successful, could harm our business, be expensive to remedy and damage our reputation. We have implemented certain systems and processes to thwart hackers and protect our data and systems, but the techniques used to gain unauthorized access to data and software are constantly evolving, and we may be unable to anticipate or prevent unauthorized access. Because of our prominence, we (and/or third parties we use) may be a particularly attractive target for\n\n7", 'Table of Contents\n\nsuch attacks, and from time to time, we have experienced an unauthorized release of certain digital content assets. However, to date these unauthorized releases have not had a material impact on our service, systems or business. There is no assurance that hackers may not have a material impact on our service or systems in the future. Our insurance does not cover expenses related to such disruptions or unauthorized access. Efforts to prevent hackers from disrupting our service or otherwise accessing our systems are expensive to develop, implement and maintain. These efforts require ongoing monitoring and updating as technologies change and efforts to overcome security measures become more sophisticated, and may limit the functionality of or otherwise negatively impact our service offering and systems. Any significant disruption to our service or access to our systems could result in a loss of memberships and adversely affect our business and results of operation. Further, a penetration of our systems or a third-party’s systems or other misappropriation or misuse of personal information could subject us to business, regulatory, litigation and reputation risk, which could have a negative effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\nWe utilize our own communications and computer hardware systems located either in our facilities or in that of a third-party provider. In addition, we utilize third-party “cloud” computing services in connection with our business operations. We also utilize our own and third-party content delivery networks to help us stream TV series and movies in high volume to Netflix members over the internet. Problems faced by us or our third-party “cloud” computing or other network providers, including technological or business-related disruptions, as well as cybersecurity threats and regulatory interference, could adversely impact the experience of our members.\n\nWe rely upon Amazon Web Services to operate certain aspects of our service and any disruption of or interference with our use of the Amazon Web Services operation would impact our operations and our business would be adversely impacted.\n\nAmazon Web Services (“AWS”) provides a distributed computing infrastructure platform for business operations, or what is commonly referred to as a "cloud" computing service. We have architected our software and computer systems so as to utilize data processing, storage capabilities and other services provided by AWS. Currently, we run the vast majority of our computing on AWS. Given this, along with the fact that we cannot easily switch our AWS operations to another cloud provider, any disruption of or interference with our use of AWS would impact our operations and our business would be adversely impacted. While the retail side of Amazon competes with us, we do not believe that Amazon will use the AWS operation in such a manner as to gain competitive advantage against our service, although if it was to do so it could harm our business.\n\nIf the technology we use in operating our business fails, is unavailable, or does not operate to expectations, our business and results of operation could be adversely impacted.\n\nWe utilize a combination of proprietary and third-party technology to operate our business. This includes the technology that we have developed to recommend and merchandise content to our consumers as well as enable fast and efficient delivery of content to our members and their various consumer electronic devices. For example, we have built and deployed our own content-delivery network (“CDN”). To the extent Internet Service Providers (“ISPs”) do not interconnect with our CDN or charge us to access their networks, or if we experience difficulties in our CDN’s operation, our ability to efficiently and effectively deliver our streaming content to our members could be adversely impacted and our business and results of operation could be adversely affected. Likewise, if our recommendation and merchandising technology does not enable us to predict and recommend titles that our members will enjoy, our ability to attract and retain members may be adversely affected. We also utilize third-party technology to help market our service, process payments, and otherwise manage the daily operations of our business. If our technology or that of third-parties we utilize in our operations fails or otherwise operates improperly, including as a result of “bugs” in our development and deployment of software, our ability to operate our service, retain existing members and add new members may be impaired. Any harm to our members’ personal computers or other devices caused by software used in our operations could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\n\nIf government regulations relating to the internet or other areas of our business change, we may need to alter the manner in which we conduct our business, or incur greater operating expenses.\n\nThe adoption or modification of laws or regulations relating to the internet or other areas of our business could limit or otherwise adversely affect the manner in which we currently conduct our business. As our service and others like us gain traction in international markets, governments are increasingly looking to introduce new or extend legacy regulations to these services, in particular those related to broadcast media and tax. For example, recent changes to European law enables individual member states to impose levies and other financial obligations on media operators located outside their jurisdiction. We anticipate that several jurisdictions may, over time, impose greater financial and regulatory obligations on us. In addition, the continued growth and development of the market for online commerce may lead to more stringent consumer protection laws, which may impose additional burdens on us. If we are required to comply with new regulations or legislation or new interpretations of existing regulations or legislation, this compliance could cause us to incur additional expenses or alter our business model.\n\n8', 'Table of Contents\n\nChanges in laws or regulations that adversely affect the growth, popularity or use of the internet, including laws impacting net neutrality, could decrease the demand for our service and increase our cost of doing business. Certain laws intended to prevent network operators from discriminating against the legal traffic that traverse their networks have been implemented in many countries, including across the European Union. In others, the laws may be nascent or non-existent. Furthermore, favorable laws may change, including for example, in the United States where net neutrality regulations were repealed. Given uncertainty around these rules, including changing interpretations, amendments or repeal, coupled with potentially significant political and economic power of local network operators, we could experience discriminatory or anti-competitive practices that could impede our growth, cause us to incur additional expense or otherwise negatively affect our business.\n\nChanges in how network operators handle and charge for access to data that travel across their networks could adversely impact our business.\n\nWe rely upon the ability of consumers to access our service through the internet. If network operators block, restrict or otherwise impair access to our service over their networks, our service and business could be negatively affected. To the extent that network operators implement usage based pricing, including meaningful bandwidth caps, or otherwise try to monetize access to their networks by data providers, we could incur greater operating expenses and our membership acquisition and retention could be negatively impacted. Furthermore, to the extent network operators create tiers of internet access service and either charge us for or prohibit us from being available through these tiers, our business could be negatively impacted.\n\nMost network operators that provide consumers with access to the internet also provide these consumers with multichannel video programming. As such, many network operators have an incentive to use their network infrastructure in a manner adverse to our continued growth and success. While we believe that consumer demand, regulatory oversight and competition will help check these incentives, to the extent that network operators are able to provide preferential treatment to their data as opposed to ours or otherwise implement discriminatory network management practices, our business could be negatively impacted. The extent to which these incentives limit operator behavior differs across markets.\n\nPrivacy concerns could limit our ability to collect and leverage member personal information and other data and disclosure of member personal information and other data could adversely impact our business and reputation.\n\nIn the ordinary course of business and in particular in connection with content acquisition and merchandising our service to our members, we collect and utilize information supplied by our members, which may include personal information and other data. We currently face certain legal obligations regarding the manner in which we treat such information, including but not limited to Regulation (EU) 2016/679 (also known as the General Data Protection Regulation or “GDPR”) and the California Consumer Privacy Act ("CCPA"). Any actual or perceived failure to comply with the GDPR, the CCPA, other data privacy laws or regulations, or related contractual or other obligations, or any perceived privacy rights violation, could lead to investigations, claims, and proceedings by governmental entities and private parties, damages for contract breach, and other significant costs, penalties, and other liabilities, as well as harm to our reputation and market position.\n\nOther businesses have been criticized by privacy groups and governmental bodies for attempts to link personal identities and other information to data collected on the internet regarding users’ browsing and other habits. Increased regulation of data utilization practices, including self-regulation or findings under existing laws that limit our ability to collect, transfer and use information and other data, could have an adverse effect on our business. In addition, if we were to disclose information and other data about our members in a manner that was objectionable to them, our business reputation could be adversely affected, and we could face potential legal claims that could impact our operating results. Internationally, we may become subject to additional and/or more stringent legal obligations concerning our treatment of customer and other personal information, such as laws regarding data localization and/or restrictions on data export. Failure to comply with these obligations could subject us to liability, and to the extent that we need to alter our business model or practices to adapt to these obligations, we could incur additional expenses.\n\nOur reputation and relationships with members would be harmed if member personal information and other data, particularly billing data, were to be accessed by unauthorized persons.\n\nWe maintain personal information and other data regarding our members, including names and billing information. This information and data is maintained on our own systems as well as that of third parties we use in our operations. With respect to billing information, such as credit card numbers, we rely on encryption and authentication technology to secure such information. We take measures to protect against unauthorized intrusion into our members’ information and other data. Despite these measures we, our payment processing services or other third-party services we use such as AWS, could experience an unauthorized intrusion into our members’ information and other data. In the event of such a breach, current and potential members may become unwilling to provide the information to us necessary for them to remain or become members. We also may be required to notify regulators about any actual or perceived data breach (including the EU Lead Data Protection\n\n9', 'Table of Contents\n\nAuthority) as well as the individuals who are affected by the incident within strict time periods. Additionally, we could face legal claims or regulatory fines or penalties for such a breach. The costs relating to any data breach could be material, and we currently do not carry insurance against the risk of a data breach. We also maintain personal information and other data concerning our employees, as well as personal information of others working on our productions. Should an unauthorized intrusion into our members’ or employees’ personal information and other data and/or production personal information occur, our business could be adversely affected and our larger reputation with respect to data protection could be negatively impacted.\n\nWe are subject to payment processing risk.\n\nOur members pay for our service using a variety of different payment methods, including credit and debit cards, gift cards, prepaid cards, direct debit, online wallets and direct carrier and partner billing. We rely on internal systems as well as those of third parties to process payment. Acceptance and processing of these payment methods are subject to certain rules and regulations, including additional authentication requirements for certain payment methods, and require payment of interchange and other fees. To the extent there are increases in payment processing fees, material changes in the payment ecosystem, such as large re-issuances of payment cards, delays in receiving payments from payment processors, changes to rules or regulations concerning payments, loss of payment partners and/or disruptions or failures in our payment processing systems, partner systems or payment products, including products we use to update payment information, our revenue, operating expenses and results of operation could be adversely impacted. In certain instances, we leverage third parties such as our cable and other partners to bill subscribers on our behalf. If these third parties become unwilling or unable to continue processing payments on our behalf, we would have to transition subscribers or otherwise find alternative methods of collecting payments, which could adversely impact member acquisition and retention. In addition, from time to time, we encounter fraudulent use of payment methods, which could impact our results of operations and if not adequately controlled and managed could create negative consumer perceptions of our service. If we are unable to maintain our fraud and chargeback rate at acceptable levels, card networks may impose fines, our card approval rate may be impacted and we may be subject to additional card authentication requirements. The termination of our ability to process payments on any major payment method would significantly impair our ability to operate our business.\n\nIf our trademarks and other proprietary rights are not adequately protected to prevent use or appropriation by our competitors, the value of our brand and other intangible assets may be diminished, and our business may be adversely affected.\n\nWe rely and expect to continue to rely on a combination of confidentiality and license agreements with our employees, consultants and third parties with whom we have relationships, as well as trademark, copyright, patent and trade secret protection laws, to protect our proprietary rights. We may also seek to enforce our proprietary rights through court proceedings or other legal actions. We have filed and we expect to file from time to time for trademark and patent applications. Nevertheless, these applications may not be approved, third parties may challenge any copyrights, patents or trademarks issued to or held by us, third parties may knowingly or unknowingly infringe our intellectual property rights, and we may not be able to prevent infringement or misappropriation without substantial expense to us. If the protection of our intellectual property rights is inadequate to prevent use or misappropriation by third parties, the value of our brand, content, and other intangible assets may be diminished, competitors may be able to more effectively mimic our service and methods of operations, the perception of our business and service to members and potential members may become confused in the marketplace, and our ability to attract members may be adversely affected.\n\nWe currently hold various domain names relating to our brand, including Netflix.com. Failure to protect our domain names could adversely affect our reputation and brand and make it more difficult for users to find our website and our service. We may be unable, without significant cost or at all, to prevent third parties from acquiring domain names that are similar to, infringe upon or otherwise decrease the value of our trademarks and other proprietary rights.\n\nIntellectual property claims against us could be costly and result in the loss of significant rights related to, among other things, our website, streaming technology, our recommendation and merchandising technology, title selection processes and marketing activities.\n\nTrademark, copyright, patent and other intellectual property rights are important to us and other companies. Our intellectual property rights extend to our technology, business processes and the content we produce and distribute through our service. We use the intellectual property of third parties in creating some of our content, merchandising our products and marketing our service. From time to time, third parties allege that we have violated their intellectual property rights. If we are unable to obtain sufficient rights, successfully defend our use, or develop non-infringing technology or otherwise alter our business practices on a timely basis in response to claims against us for infringement, misappropriation, misuse or other violation of third-party intellectual property rights, our business and competitive position may be adversely affected. Many companies are devoting significant resources to developing patents that could potentially affect many aspects of our business. There are numerous patents that broadly claim means and methods of conducting business on the internet. We have not\n\n10', 'Table of Contents\n\nsearched patents relative to our technology. Defending ourselves against intellectual property claims, whether they are with or without merit or are determined in our favor, results in costly litigation and diversion of technical and management personnel. It also may result in our inability to use our current website, streaming technology, our recommendation and merchandising technology or inability to market our service or merchandise our products. We may also have to remove content from our service, or remove consumer products or marketing materials from the marketplace. As a result of a dispute, we may have to develop non-infringing technology, enter into royalty or licensing agreements, adjust our content, merchandising or marketing activities or take other actions to resolve the claims. These actions, if required, may be costly or unavailable on terms acceptable to us.\n\nWe are engaged in legal proceedings that could cause us to incur unforeseen expenses and could occupy a significant amount of our management\'s time and attention.\n\nFrom time to time, we are subject to litigation or claims that could negatively affect our business operations and financial position. As we have grown, we have seen a rise in the number of litigation matters against us. These matters have included copyright and other claims related to our content, patent infringement claims, employment related litigation, as well as consumer and securities class actions, each of which are typically expensive to defend. Litigation disputes could cause us to incur unforeseen expenses, result in content unavailability, service disruptions, and otherwise occupy a significant amount of our management\'s time and attention, any of which could negatively affect our business operations and financial position. We also from time to time receive inquiries and subpoenas and other types of information requests from government authorities and we may become subject to related claims and other actions related to our business activities. While the ultimate outcome of investigations, inquiries, information requests and related legal proceedings is difficult to predict, such matters can be expensive, time-consuming and distracting, and adverse resolutions or settlements of those matters may result in, among other things, modification of our business practices, reputational harm or costs and significant payments, any of which could negatively affect our business operations and financial position.\n\nWe may seek additional capital that may result in stockholder dilution or that may have rights senior to those of our common stockholders.\n\nFrom time to time, we may seek to obtain additional capital, either through equity, equity-linked or debt securities. Our cash flows provided by our operating activities have been negative in each of the last five years, primarily as a result of our decision to increase the amount of original streaming content available on our service. We expect our cash flows from operations to continue to be negative for some time, and anticipate seeking additional capital. The decision to obtain additional capital will depend on, among other things, our business plans, operating performance and condition of the capital markets. Any disruption in the capital markets could make it more difficult and expensive for us to raise additional capital or refinance our existing indebtedness. If we raise additional funds through the issuance of equity, equity-linked or debt securities, those securities may have rights, preferences or privileges senior to the rights of our common stock, and our stockholders may experience dilution. Any large equity or equity-linked offering could also negatively impact our stock price.\n\nWe have a substantial amount of indebtedness and other obligations, including streaming content obligations, which could adversely affect our financial position.\n\nWe have a substantial amount of indebtedness and other obligations, including streaming content obligations. Moreover, we expect to incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future and to incur other obligations, including additional streaming content obligations. If the financial markets become difficult or costly to access, our ability to raise additional capital may be negatively impacted. As of December\xa031, 2019, we had the equivalent of $14.9 billion aggregate principal amount of senior notes outstanding (“Notes”), some of which is denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. In addition, we have entered into a revolving credit agreement that provides for a $750 million unsecured revolving credit facility. As of December\xa031, 2019, we have not borrowed any amount under this revolving credit facility. As of December\xa031, 2019, we had approximately $7.7 billion of total content liabilities as reflected on our consolidated balance sheet, some of which is denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Such amount does not include streaming content commitments that do not meet the criteria for liability recognition, the amounts of which are significant. For more information on our streaming content obligations, including those not on our consolidated balance sheet, see Note 5, Commitments and Contingencies in the accompanying notes to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8, "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Our substantial indebtedness and other obligations, including streaming content obligations, may:\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  |  |\n| • | make it difficult for us to satisfy our financial obligations, including making scheduled principal and interest payments on our Notes and our other obligations; |\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  |  |\n| • | limit our ability to borrow additional funds for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions or other general business purposes; |\n\n11', 'Table of Contents\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  |  |\n| • | increase our cost of borrowing; |\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  |  |\n| • | limit our ability to use our cash flow or obtain additional financing for future working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions or other general business purposes; |\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  |  |\n| • | require us to use a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to make debt service payments and pay our other obligations when due; |\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  |  |\n| • | limit our flexibility to plan for, or react to, changes in our business and industry; |\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  |  |\n| • | place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our less leveraged competitors; and |\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  |  |\n| • | increase our vulnerability to the impact of adverse economic and industry conditions, including changes in interest rates and foreign exchange rates. |\n\nOur streaming obligations include large multi-year commitments. As a result, we may be unable to react to any downturn in the economy or reduction in our cash flows from operations by reducing our streaming content obligations in the near-term. This could result in our needing to access the capital markets at an unfavorable time, which may negatively impact our stock price.\n\nThe interest rate of borrowings under our revolving credit agreement makes reference to an adjusted London interbank offered rate ("LIBO Rate"). It is possible that beginning in 2022, the LIBO Rate will be discontinued as a reference rate. Under our revolving credit agreement, in the event of the discontinuance of the LIBO Rate, a mutually agreed-upon alternate benchmark rate will be established to replace the LIBO Rate.\xa0 In the event that an agreement cannot be reached on an appropriate benchmark rate, the availability of borrowings under our revolving credit agreement could be adversely impacted.\n\nWe may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service our debt and other obligations.\n\nOur ability to make payments on our debt, including our Notes, and our other obligations will depend on our financial and operating performance, which is subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions and to certain financial, business and other factors beyond our control. In each of the last five years, our cash flows from operating activities have been negative. We may be unable to attain a level of cash flows from operating activities sufficient to permit us to pay the principal, premium, if any, and interest on our debt, including the Notes, and other obligations, including amounts due under our streaming content obligations.\n\nIf we are unable to service our debt and other obligations from cash flows, we may need to refinance or restructure all or a portion of such obligations prior to maturity. Our ability to refinance or restructure our debt and other obligations will depend upon the condition of the capital markets and our financial condition at such time. Any refinancing or restructuring could be at higher interest rates and may require us to comply with more onerous covenants, which could further restrict our business operations. If our cash flows are insufficient to service our debt and other obligations, we may not be able to refinance or restructure any of these obligations on commercially reasonable terms or at all and any refinancing or restructuring could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition.\n\nIf our cash flows are insufficient to fund our debt and other obligations and we are unable to refinance or restructure these obligations, we could face substantial liquidity problems and may be forced to reduce or delay investments and capital expenditures, or to sell material assets or operations to meet our debt and other obligations. We cannot assure you that we would be able to implement any of these alternative measures on satisfactory terms or at all or that the proceeds from such alternatives would be adequate to meet any debt or other obligations then due. If it becomes necessary to implement any of these alternative measures, our business, results of operations, or financial condition could be materially and adversely affected.\n\nWe may lose key employees or may be unable to hire qualified employees.\n\nWe rely on the continued service of our senior management, including our Chief Executive Officer and co-founder Reed Hastings, members of our executive team and other key employees and the hiring of new qualified employees. In our industry, there is substantial and continuous competition for highly-skilled business, product development, technical, creative and other personnel. If we experience high executive turnover, are not successful in recruiting new personnel or in retaining and motivating existing personnel, in instilling our culture in new employees, or improving our culture as we grow, our operations may be disrupted.\n\nLabor disputes may have an adverse effect on the Company’s business.\n\nOur partners, suppliers, vendors and we employ the services of writers, directors, actors and other talent as well as trade employees and others who are subject to collective bargaining agreements in the motion picture industry, both in the U.S. and internationally. Expiring collective bargaining agreements may be renewed on terms that are unfavorable to us. If expiring collective bargaining agreements cannot be renewed, then it is possible that the affected unions could take action in the form of strikes or work stoppages. Such actions, as well as higher costs or operating complexities in connection with these collective\n\n12', 'Table of Contents\n\nbargaining agreements or a significant labor dispute, could have an adverse effect on our business by causing delays in production, added costs or by reducing profit margins.\n\nRisks Related to Our Stock Ownership\n\nProvisions in our charter documents and under Delaware law could discourage a takeover that stockholders may consider favorable.\n\nOur charter documents may discourage, delay or prevent a merger or acquisition that a stockholder may consider favorable because they:\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  |  |\n| • | authorize our board of directors, without stockholder approval, to issue up to 10,000,000 shares of undesignated preferred stock; |\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  |  |\n| • | provide for a classified board of directors; |\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  |  |\n| • | prohibit our stockholders from acting by written consent; |\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  |  |\n| • | establish advance notice requirements for proposing matters to be approved by stockholders at stockholder meetings; and |\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  |  |\n| • | prohibit stockholders from calling a special meeting of stockholders. |\n\nAs a Delaware corporation, we are also subject to certain Delaware anti-takeover provisions. Under Delaware law, a corporation may not engage in a business combination with any holder of 15% or more of its capital stock unless the holder has held the stock for three years or, among other things, the board of directors has approved the transaction. Our board of directors could rely on Delaware law to prevent or delay an acquisition of us.\n\nIn addition, a merger or acquisition may trigger retention payments to certain executive employees under the terms of our Amended and Restated Executive Severance and Retention Incentive Plan, thereby increasing the cost of such a transaction.\n\nOur stock price is volatile.\n\nThe price at which our common stock has traded has fluctuated significantly. The price may continue to be volatile due to a number of factors including the following, some of which are beyond our control:\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  |  |\n| • | variations in our operating results, including our membership acquisition and retention, revenues, operating income, net income and free cash flow; |\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  |  |\n| • | variations between our actual operating results and the expectations of securities analysts, investors and the financial community; |\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  |  |\n| • | announcements of developments affecting our business, systems or expansion plans by us or others; |\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  |  |\n| • | competition, including the introduction of new competitors, their pricing strategies and services; |\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  |  |\n| • | market volatility in general; |\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  |  |\n| • | the level of demand for our stock, including the amount of short interest in our stock; and |\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  |  |\n| • | the operating results of our competitors. |\n\nAs a result of these and other factors, investors in our common stock may not be able to resell their shares at or above their original purchase price.\n\nFollowing certain periods of volatility in the market price of our securities, we became the subject of securities litigation. We may experience more such litigation following future periods of volatility. This type of litigation may result in substantial costs and a diversion of management’s attention and resources.\n\nPreparing and forecasting our financial results requires us to make judgments and estimates which may differ materially from actual results.\n\nGiven the dynamic nature of our business, and the inherent limitations in predicting the future, forecasts of our revenues, operating margins, net income and number of paid membership additions and other financial and operating data may differ materially from actual results. Such discrepancies could cause a decline in the trading price of our common stock. In addition, the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America also requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported periods. We base such estimates on historical experience and on various other\n\n13', 'Table of Contents\n\nassumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, but actual results may differ from these estimates. For example, we estimate the amortization pattern, beginning with the month of first availability, of any particular licensed or produced television series or movie based upon various factors including historical and estimated viewing patterns. If actual viewing patterns differ from these estimates, the pattern and/or period of amortization would be changed and could affect the timing or recognition of content amortization. If we revise such estimates it could result in greater in-period expenses, which could cause us to miss our earnings guidance or negatively impact the results we report which could negatively impact our stock price.\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  |  |\n| Item 1B. | Unresolved Staff Comments |\n\nNone.\n\n14', 'Table of Contents\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  |  |\n| Item 2. | Properties |\n\nWe have leased principal properties in both Los Gatos, California, which is the location of our corporate headquarters, and in Los Angeles, California, and have entered into leases for additional space in these locations to become available over the next year.

The increase in our consolidated revenues was due to the 23% growth in average paying memberships and a 5% increase in average monthly revenue per paying membership. The increase in average monthly revenue per paying membership resulted from our price changes and plan mix, partially offset by unfavorable fluctuations in foreign exchange rates.\n\nThe increase in operating margin is due primarily to increased revenues, partially offset by increased content expenses as we continue to acquire, license and produce content, including more Netflix originals, as well as increased marketing expenses and headcount costs to support continued improvements in our streaming service, our international expansion, and our growing content production activities.\n\nStreaming Revenues\n\nWe derive revenues from monthly membership fees for services related to streaming content to our members. We offer a variety of streaming membership plans, the price of which varies by country and the features of the plan. As of December 31, 2019, pricing on our plans ranged from the U.S. dollar equivalent of $3 to $22 per month. We expect that from time to time the prices of our membership plans in each country may change and we may test other plan and price variations.\n\nThe following tables summarize streaming revenue and

in analyzing the underlying trends in average monthly revenue per paying membership. In order to exclude the effect of foreign currency rate fluctuations on average monthly revenue per paying membership, we estimate current period revenue assuming foreign exchange rates had remained constant with foreign exchange rates from each of the corresponding months of the prior-year period. For the year ended December\xa031, 2019, our revenues would have been approximately $762 million higher had foreign currency exchange rates remained constant with those for the year ended December\xa031, 2018.\n\nCost of Revenues\n\nAmortization of streaming content assets makes up the majority of cost of revenues. Expenses associated with the acquisition, licensing and production of streaming content (such as payroll and related personnel expenses, costs associated with obtaining rights to music included in our content, overall deals with talent, miscellaneous production related costs and participations and residuals), streaming delivery costs and other operations costs make up the remainder of cost of revenues. We have built our own global content delivery network (“Open Connect”) to help us efficiently stream a high volume of content to our members over the internet. Streaming delivery expenses, therefore, include equipment costs related to Open Connect, payroll and related personnel expenses and all third-party costs, such as cloud computing costs, associated with delivering streaming content over the internet. Other operations costs include customer service and payment processing fees, including those we pay to our integrated payment partners, as well as other costs incurred in making our content available to members.\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|  |  | Year Ended December 31, | | | | | | | | | | |  | Change | | | | | | | | | | | | |\n|  |  | 2019 | | |  | 2018 | | |  | 2017 | | |  | 2019 vs. 2018 | | | | | |  | 2018 vs. 2017 | | | | | |\n|  |  | (in\xa0thousands,\xa0except\xa0percentages) | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |\n| Cost of revenues |  | $ | 12,440,213 |  |  | $ | 9,967,538 |  |  | $ | 8,033,000 |  |  | $ | 2,472,675 |  |  | 25 | % |  | $ | 1,934,538 |  |  | 24 | % |\n| As a percentage of revenues |  | 62 | | % |  | 63 | | % |  | 69 | | % |  |  | | |  |  | |  |  | | |  |  | |\n\nThe increase in cost of revenues for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2018 was primarily due to a $1,684 million increase in content amortization relating to our existing and new streaming content, including more exclusive and original programming. Other costs increased $789 million primarily due to increases in expenses associated with the acquisition, licensing and production of streaming content as well as increased payment processing fees driven by our growing member base.\n\nMarketing\n\nMarketing expenses consist primarily of advertising expenses and certain payments made to our marketing partners, including consumer electronics ("CE") manufacturers, MVPDs, mobile operators and ISPs. Advertising expenses include promotional activities such as digital and television advertising. Marketing expenses also include payroll and related expenses for personnel that support marketing activities.\n\n22', 'Table of Contents\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|  |  | Year Ended December 31, | | | | | | | | | | |  | Change | | | | | | | | | | | | |\n|  |  | 2019 | | |  | 2018 | | |  | 2017 | | |  | 2019 vs. 2018 | | | | | |  | 2018 vs. 2017 | | | | | |\n|  |  | (in\xa0thousands,\xa0except\xa0percentages) | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |\n| Marketing |  | $ | 2,652,462 |  |  | $ | 2,369,469 |  |  | $ | 1,436,281 |  |  | $ | 282,993 |  |  | 12 | % |  | $ | 933,188 |  |  | 65 | % |\n| As a percentage of revenues |  | 13 | | % |  | 15 | | % |  | 12 | | % |  |  | | |  |  | |  |  | | |  |  | |\n\nThe increase in marketing expenses for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2018 was primarily due to a $139 million increase in personnel-related expenses, including increases in compensation for existing employees and growth in average headcount, as well as increased advertising and payments to our marketing partners.\n\nTechnology and Development\n\nTechnology and development expenses consist of payroll and related expenses for all technology personnel, as well as other costs incurred in making improvements to our service offerings, including testing, maintaining and modifying our user interface, our recommendation, merchandising and streaming delivery technology and infrastructure.

In addition, third-party expenses, including costs associated with cloud computing, increased $18 million.\n\nGeneral and Administrative\n\nGeneral and administrative expenses consist of payroll and related expenses for corporate personnel.

In addition, third-party expenses, including costs for contractors and consultants, increased $40 million.\n\nInterest Expense\n\nInterest expense consists primarily of the interest associated with our outstanding long-term debt obligations, including the amortization of debt issuance costs. See Note 4 Long-term Debt in the accompanying notes to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8, "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further detail of our long-term debt obligations.\n\n23', 'Table of Contents\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|  |  | Year Ended December\xa031, | | | | | | | | | | |  | Change | | | | | | | | | | | | |\n|  |  | 2019 | | |  | 2018 | | |  | 2017 | | |  | 2019 vs. 2018 | | | | | |  | 2018 vs. 2017 | | | | | |\n|  |  | (in thousands, except percentages) | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |\n| Interest expense |  | $ | (626,023 | ) |  | $ | (420,493 | ) |  | $ | (238,204 | ) |  | $ | 205,530 |  |  | 49 | % |  | $ | 182,289 |  |  | 77 | % |\n| As a percentage of revenues |  | (3 | | )% |  | (3 | | )% |  | (2 | | )% |  |  | | |  |  | |  |  | | |  |  | |\n\nInterest expense for the year ended December\xa031, 2019 consists primarily of $614 million of interest on our Notes. The increase in interest expense for the year ended December\xa031, 2019 as compared to the year ended December\xa031, 2018 is due to the increase in long-term debt.\n\nInterest and Other Income (Expense)\n\nInterest and other income (expense) consists primarily of foreign exchange gains and losses on foreign currency denominated balances and interest earned on cash and cash equivalents.\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|  |  | Year Ended December 31, | | | | | | | | | | |  | Change | | | | | | | | | | | | |\n|  |  | 2019 | | |  | 2018 | | |  | 2017 | | |  | 2019 vs. 2018 | | | | | |  | 2018 vs. 2017 | | | | | |\n|  |  | (in thousands, except percentages) | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |\n| Interest and other income (expense) |  | $ | 84,000 |  |  | $ | 41,725 |  |  | $ | (115,154 | ) |  | $ | 42,275 |  |  | 101 | % |  | $ | 156,879 |  |  | 136 | % |\n| As a percentage of revenues |  | — | | % |  | — | | % |  | (1 | | )% |  |  | | |  |  | |  |  | | |  |  | |\n\nInterest and other income (expense) for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2018 increased primarily due to a $30 million increase in interest income earned on cash balances, coupled with foreign exchange gains. The foreign exchange gain of $7 million in the year ended December\xa031, 2019 was primarily driven by the $46 million gain from the remeasurement of our Senior Notes denominated in euros, partially offset by the remeasurement of cash and content liability positions in currencies other than the functional currencies of our European and U.S. entities.\n\nProvision for (Benefit from) Income Taxes\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|  |  | Year Ended December\xa031, | | | | | | | | | | |  | Change | | | | | | | | | | | |\n|  |  | 2019 | | |  | 2018 | | |  | 2017 | | |  | 2019 vs. 2018 | | | | | |  | 2018 vs. 2017 | | | | |\n|  |  | (in thousands, except percentages) | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |\n| Provision for (benefit from) income taxes |  | $ | 195,315 |  |  | $ | 15,216 |  |  | $ | (73,608 | ) |  | $ | 180,099 |  |  | 1,184 | % |  | 88,824 |  |  | (121 | )% |\n| Effective tax rate |  | 9 | | % |  | 1 | | % |  | (15 | | )% |  |  | | |  |  | |  |  | |  |  | |\n\nIn connection with the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, we simplified our global corporate structure, effective April 1, 2019. The tax impacts of such simplifications were not material to the financial statements taken as a whole. During the fourth quarter of 2019, the United States Treasury issued final regulations with respect to certain aspects related to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. Additional guidance provided in these regulations resulted in a tax adjustment in the fourth quarter of 2019. We paid U.S. Federal taxes for the full year inclusive of this fourth quarter adjustment.\n\nThe increase in our effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2018 is primarily due to the global corporate structure simplification, lower benefit from the recognition of excess tax benefits of stock-based compensation, and a lower benefit on a percentage basis from Federal and California research and development ("R&D") credits. The one-time transition tax benefit under Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 ("SAB 118") that provided a measurement period to address the U.S. GAAP impacts associated with the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 is no longer applicable in 2019.\n\nIn 2019, the difference between our 9% effective tax rate and the Federal statutory rate of 21% was primarily due to the recognition of excess tax benefits of stock-based compensation, Federal and California R&D credits, and the international provisions from the U.S. tax reform enacted in 2017, partially offset by state taxes, foreign taxes, and non-deductible expenses.\n\n24', 'Table of Contents\n\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | | | | | | | |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|  | Year Ended December\xa031, | | | | | | |\n|  | 2019 | | |  | 2018 | | |\n|  | (in thousands) | | | | | | |\n| Cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash | $ | 5,043,786 |  |  | $ | 3,812,041 |  |\n| Long-term debt | 14,759,260 | |  |  | 10,360,058 | |  |\n\nCash, cash equivalents and restricted cash increased $1,232 million in the year ended December\xa031, 2019 primarily due to the issuance of debt, partially offset by cash used in operations.\n\nLong-term debt, net of debt issuance costs, increased $4,399 million due to long-term note issuances in 2019. The earliest maturity date for our outstanding long-term debt is February 2021. As of\xa0December\xa031, 2019, no amounts had been borrowed under our $750 million Revolving Credit Agreement. See Note 4 Long-term Debt in the accompanying notes to our consolidated financial statements. We anticipate continuing to finance our future capital needs in the debt market. Our ability to obtain this or any additional financing that we may choose to, or need to, obtain will depend on, among other things, our development efforts, business plans, operating performance and the condition of the capital markets at the time we seek financing. We may not be able to obtain such financing on terms acceptable to us or at all. If we raise additional funds through the issuance of equity or debt securities, those securities may have rights, preferences or privileges senior to the rights of our common stock, and our stockholders may experience dilution.\n\nOur primary uses of cash include the acquisition, licensing and production of content, streaming delivery, marketing programs and personnel-related costs. Cash payment terms for non-original content have historically been in line with the amortization period. Investments in original content, and in particular content that we produce and own, require more cash upfront relative to licensed content. For example, production costs are paid as the content is created, well in advance of when the content is available on the service and amortized. We expect to continue to significantly increase our investments in global streaming content, particularly in original content, which will impact our liquidity and result in future net cash used in operating activities and negative free cash flows for many years. We currently anticipate that cash flows from operations, available funds and access to financing sources, including our revolving credit facility, will continue to be sufficient to meet our cash needs for at least the next twelve months.\n\nFree Cash Flow\n\nWe define free cash flow as cash provided by (used in) operating and investing activities excluding the non-operational cash flows from purchases, maturities and sales of short-term investments. We believe free cash flow is an important liquidity metric because it measures, during a given period, the amount of cash generated that is available to repay debt obligations, make investments and for certain other activities or the amount of cash used in operations, including investments in global streaming content. Free cash flow is considered a non-GAAP financial measure and should not be considered in isolation of, or as a substitute for, net income, operating income, cash flow used in operating activities, or any other measure of financial performance or liquidity presented in accordance with GAAP.\n\nIn assessing liquidity in relation to our results of operations, we compare free cash flow to net income, noting that the three major recurring differences are excess content payments over amortization, non-cash stock-based compensation expense and other working capital differences. Working capital differences include deferred revenue, excess property and equipment purchases over depreciation, taxes and semi-annual interest payments on our outstanding debt. Our receivables from members generally settle quickly.\n\n25', 'Table of Contents\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | | | | | | | | | | | |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|  | Year Ended December\xa031, | | | | | | | | | | |\n|  | 2019 | | |  | 2018 | | |  | 2017 | | |\n|  | (in thousands) | | | | | | | | | | |\n| Net cash used in operating activities | $ | (2,887,322 | ) |  | $ | (2,680,479 | ) |  | $ | (1,785,948 | ) |\n| Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities | (387,064 | | ) |  | (339,120 | | ) |  | 34,329 | |  |\n| Net cash provided by financing activities | 4,505,662 | |  |  | 4,048,527 | |  |  | 3,076,990 | |  |\n|  |  | | |  |  | | |  |  | | |\n| Non-GAAP free cash flow reconciliation: |  | | |  |  | | |  |  | | |\n| Net cash used in operating activities | (2,887,322 | | ) |  | (2,680,479 | | ) |  | (1,785,948 | | ) |\n| Purchases of property and equipment | (253,035 | | ) |  | (173,946 | | ) |  | (173,302 | | ) |\n| Change in other assets | (134,029 | | ) |  | (165,174 | | ) |  | (60,409 | | ) |\n| Free cash flow | $ | (3,274,386 | ) |  | $ | (3,019,599 | ) |  | $ | (2,019,659 | ) |\n\nNet cash used in operating activities increased $207 million from the year ended December\xa031, 2018 to $2,887 million for the year ended December\xa031, 2019. The increased use of cash was primarily driven by the increase in investments in streaming content that require more upfront payments, partially offset by a $4,362 million or 28% increase in revenues. The payments for streaming content assets increased $2,567 million, from $12,044 million to $14,611 million, or 21%, as compared to the increase in the amortization of streaming content assets of $1,684 million, from $7,532 million to $9,216 million, or 22%. In addition, we had increased payments associated with higher operating expenses, primarily related to increased headcount to support our continued improvements in our streaming service, our international expansion and increased content production activities.\n\nNet cash used in investing activities increased $48 million, primarily due to an increase in purchases of property and equipment.\n\nNet cash provided by financing activities increased $457 million due to an increase in the proceeds from the issuance of debt of $507 million from $3,926 million in the year ended December\xa031, 2018 to $4,433 million in the year ended December\xa031, 2019. In addition, we had a decrease in the proceeds from the issuance of common stock of $52 million.\n\nFree cash flow was $5,141 million lower than net income for the year ended December\xa031, 2019 primarily due to $5,394 million of cash payments for streaming content assets over streaming amortization expense and $152 million in other non-favorable working capital differences, partially offset by $405 million of non-cash stock-based compensation expense.\n\nContractual Obligations\n\nFor the purpose of this table, contractual obligations for purchases of goods or services are defined as agreements that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. The expected timing of the payment of the obligations discussed below is estimated based on information available to us as of December\xa031, 2019. Timing of payments and actual amounts paid may be different depending on the time of receipt of goods or services or changes to agreed-upon amounts for some obligations.

An obligation for the production of content includes non-cancelable commitments under creative talent and employment agreements and other production related commitments. An obligation for the acquisition and licensing of content is incurred at the time we enter into an agreement to obtain future titles. Once a title becomes available, a content liability is recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Certain agreements include the obligation to license rights for unknown future titles, the ultimate quantity and/or fees for which are not yet determinable as of the reporting date. Traditional film output deals, or certain TV series license agreements where the number of seasons to be aired is unknown, are examples of these types of agreements. The contractual obligations table above does not include any estimated obligation for the unknown future titles, payment for which could range from less than one year to more than five years. However, these unknown obligations are expected to be significant and we believe could include approximately $1 billion to $4 billion over the next three years, with the payments for the vast majority of such amounts expected to occur after the next twelve months. The foregoing range is based on considerable management judgments and the actual amounts may differ. Once we know the title that we will receive and the license fees, we include the amount in the contractual obligations table above.\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  |  |\n| (2) | Long-term debt obligations include our Notes consisting of principal and interest payments. See Note 4 Long-term Debt in the accompanying notes to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8, "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further details. |\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  |  |\n| (3) | See Note 3 Leases in the accompanying notes to our consolidated financial statements for further details regarding leases. As of December\xa031, 2019, the Company has additional operating leases for real estate that have not yet commenced of $699 million which has been included above. Total lease obligations as of December\xa031, 2019 increased $1,049 million from $1,708 million as of December\xa031, 2018 to $2,757 million as of December\xa031, 2019 due to growth in facilities to support our growing headcount and growing number of original productions. |\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  |  |\n| (4) | Other purchase obligations include all other non-cancelable contractual obligations. These contracts are primarily related to streaming delivery and cloud computing costs, as well as other miscellaneous open purchase orders for which we have not received the related services or goods. |\n\nAs of December\xa031, 2019, we had gross unrecognized tax benefits of $67 million which was classified in “Other non-current liabilities” and a reduction to deferred tax assets which was classified as "Other non-current assets" in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. At this time, an estimate of the range of reasonably possible adjustments to the balance of unrecognized tax benefits cannot be made.\n\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\n\nWe do not have transactions with unconsolidated entities, such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities, whereby we have financial guarantees, subordinated retained interests, derivative instruments, or other contingent arrangements that expose us to material continuing risks, contingent liabilities, or any other obligation under a variable interest in an unconsolidated entity that provides financing, liquidity, market risk, or credit risk support to us.\n\nIndemnifications\n\nThe information set forth under Note 6 Guarantees - Indemnification Obligations in the accompanying notes to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8, "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K is incorporated herein by reference.\n\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\n\nThe preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported periods. The Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") has defined a company’s critical accounting policies as the ones that are most important to the portrayal of a company’s financial condition and results of operations, and which require a company to make its most difficult and subjective judgments. Based on this definition, we have identified the critical accounting policies and judgments addressed below. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates.\n\n27', 'Table of Contents\n\nStreaming Content\n\nWe acquire, license and produce content, including original programing, in order to offer our members unlimited viewing of entertainment. The content licenses are for a fixed fee and specific windows of availability. Payment terms for certain content licenses and the production of content require more upfront cash payments relative to the amortization expense. Payments for content, including additions to streaming assets and the changes in related liabilities, are classified within "Net cash used in operating activities" on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.\n\nWe recognize content assets (licensed and produced) as "Non-current content assets, net" on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. For licenses, we capitalize the fee per title and record a corresponding liability at the gross amount of the liability when the license period begins, the cost of the title is known and the title is accepted and available for streaming. For productions, we capitalize costs associated with the production, including development cost, direct costs and production overhead. Participations and residuals are expensed in line with the amortization of production costs.\n\nBased on factors including historical and estimated viewing patterns, we amortize the content assets (licensed and produced) in “Cost of revenues” on the Consolidated Statements of Operations over the shorter of each title\'s contractual window of availability or estimated period of use or ten years, beginning with the month of first availability. The amortization is on an accelerated basis, as we typically expect more upfront viewing, for instance due to additional merchandising and marketing efforts, and film amortization is more accelerated than TV series amortization. On average, over 90% of a licensed or produced streaming content asset is expected to be amortized within four years after its month of first availability. We review factors that impact the amortization of the content assets on a regular basis. Our estimates related to these factors require considerable management judgment.\n\nOur business model is subscription based as opposed to a model generating revenues at a specific title level. Content assets (licensed and produced) are predominantly monetized as a group and therefore are reviewed at a group level when an event or change in circumstances indicates a change in the expected usefulness of the content or that the fair value may be less than unamortized cost. To date, we have not identified any such event or changes in circumstances. If such changes are identified in the future, these aggregated content assets will be stated at the lower of unamortized cost or fair value. In addition, unamortized costs for assets that have been, or are expected to be, abandoned are written off.\n\nIncome Taxes\n\nWe record a provision for income taxes for the anticipated tax consequences of our reported results of operations using the asset and liability method. Deferred income taxes are recognized by applying enacted statutory tax rates applicable to future years to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases as well as net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. The measurement of deferred tax assets is reduced, if necessary, by a valuation allowance for any tax benefits for which future realization is uncertain.\n\nAlthough we believe our assumptions, judgments and estimates are reasonable, changes in tax laws or our interpretation of tax laws and the resolution of any tax audits could significantly impact the amounts provided for income taxes in our consolidated financial statements.\n\nIn evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets, in full or in part, we consider all available positive and negative evidence, including our past operating results, and our forecast of future earnings, future taxable income and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies. The assumptions utilized in determining future taxable income require significant judgment and are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying businesses. Actual operating results in future years could differ from our current assumptions, judgments and estimates. However, we believe that it is more likely than not that most of the deferred tax assets recorded on our Consolidated Balance Sheets will ultimately be realized. We record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the net amount that we believe is more likely than not to be realized. At December\xa031, 2019 the valuation allowance of $135 million was primarily related to foreign tax credits that we are not expected to realize.\n\nWe did not recognize certain tax benefits from uncertain tax positions within the provision for income taxes. We may recognize a tax benefit only if it is more likely than not the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such positions are then measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon settlement. At December\xa031, 2019, our estimated gross unrecognized tax benefits were $67 million of which $57 million, if recognized, would favorably impact our future earnings. Due to uncertainties in any tax audit outcome, our estimates of the ultimate settlement of our unrecognized tax positions may change and the actual tax benefits may differ significantly from the estimates.\n\nSee Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements for further information regarding income taxes.\n\n28', 'Table of Contents\n\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\n\nThe information set forth under Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements under the caption “Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” is incorporated herein by reference.\n\n29', 'Table of Contents\n\nHistorical Segment Information\n\nHistorically, we reported contribution profit (loss) for three segments: Domestic streaming, International streaming and Domestic DVD, which was reflective of how our chief operating decision maker ("CODM") reviewed financial information for the purposes of making operating decisions, assessing financial performance and allocating resources. Contribution profit (loss) is defined as revenues less cost of revenues and marketing expenses incurred by the segment. Because we increasingly obtain multi-territory or global rights for streaming content, contribution profit (loss) on a regional basis is no longer a meaningful metric reviewed by the CODM or used in the allocation of resources.\n\nEffective in the fourth quarter of 2019, we operate as a single operating segment. Our CODM is our chief executive officer, who reviews financial information presented on a consolidated basis for purposes of making operating decisions, assessing financial performance and allocating resources.\n\nAs the transition to one segment occurred during 2019, we are providing supplemental pro-forma information reflecting our historic segment reporting as if it had remained in place for the full year ended December 31, 2019 as follows:\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|  | As of/Year ended December 31, 2019 | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |\n|  | Domestic  Streaming | | |  | International  Streaming | | |  | Domestic  DVD | | |  | Consolidated | | |\n|  | (in thousands) | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |\n| Total paid memberships at end of period | 61,043 | |  |  | 106,047 | |  |  | 2,153 | |  |  |  | | |\n| Total paid net membership additions (losses) | 2,557 | |  |  | 25,274 | |  |  | (553 | | ) |  |  | | |\n| Revenues | $ | 9,243,005 |  |  | $ | 10,616,225 |  |  | $ | 297,217 |  |  | $ | 20,156,447 |  |\n| Cost of revenues | 4,867,343 | |  |  | 7,449,663 | |  |  | 123,207 | |  |  | 12,440,213 | |  |\n| Marketing | 1,063,042 | |  |  | 1,589,420 | |  |  | — | |  |  | 2,652,462 | |  |\n| Contribution profit | $ | 3,312,620 |  |  | $ | 1,577,142 |  |  | $ | 174,010 |  |  | 5,063,772 | |  |\n| Other operating expenses |  | | |  |  | | |  |  | | |  | 2,459,518 | |  |\n| Operating income |  | | |  |  | | |  |  | | |  | 2,604,254 | |  |\n| Other income (expense) |  | | |  |  | | |  |  | | |  | (542,023 | | ) |\n| Provision for income taxes |  | | |  |  | | |  |  | | |  | 195,315 | |  |\n| Net income |  | | |  |  | | |  |  | | |  | $ | 1,866,916 |  |\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  |  |\n| Item 7A. | Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk |\n\nWe are exposed to market risks related to interest rate changes and the corresponding changes in the market values of our debt and foreign currency fluctuations.\n\nInterest Rate Risk\n\nAt December\xa031, 2019, our cash equivalents were generally invested in money market funds. Interest paid on such funds fluctuates with the prevailing interest rate.\n\nAs of December\xa031, 2019, we had $14.9 billion of debt, consisting of fixed rate unsecured debt in fourteen tranches due between 2021 and 2030. Refer to Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements for details about all issuances. The fair value of our debt will fluctuate with movements of interest rates, increasing in periods of declining rates of interest and declining in periods of increasing rates of interest. The fair value of our debt will also fluctuate based on changes in foreign currency rates, as discussed below.\n\nForeign Currency Risk\n\nRevenues denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar account for 50% of the consolidated amount for the year ended December\xa031, 2019. We therefore have foreign currency risk related to these currencies, which are primarily the euro, the British pound, the Canadian dollar, the Australian dollar, the Japanese yen, the Mexican peso and the Brazilian real.\n\nAccordingly, changes in exchange rates, and in particular a weakening of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar may negatively affect our revenue and operating income as expressed in U.S. dollars. For the year ended December\xa031, 2019,\n\n30', 'Table of Contents\n\nour revenues would have been approximately $762 million higher had foreign currency exchange rates remained constant with those for the year ended December\xa031, 2018.\n\nWe have also experienced and will continue to experience fluctuations in our net income as a result of gains (losses) on the settlement and the remeasurement of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies that are not the functional currency. In the year ended December\xa031, 2019, we recognized a $7 million foreign exchange gain due to the remeasurement of our Senior Notes denominated in euros, partially offset by the remeasurement of cash and content liability positions denominated in currencies other than functional currencies of our European and U.S. entities.\n\nExchange rate changes had an immaterial impact on cash and cash equivalents in the year ended December\xa031, 2019.\n\nWe do not use foreign exchange contracts or derivatives to hedge any foreign currency exposures. The volatility of exchange rates depends on many factors that we cannot forecast with reliable accuracy. Our continued international expansion increases our exposure to exchange rate fluctuations and as a result such fluctuations could have a significant impact on our future results of operations.\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  |  |\n| Item 8. | Financial Statements and Supplementary Data |\n\nThe consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes listed in Part IV, Item\xa015(a)(1) of this Annual Report on Form 10-K are included immediately following Part IV hereof and incorporated by reference herein.\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  |  |\n| Item 9. | Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure |\n\nNone.\n\n31', 'Table of Contents\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  |  |\n| Item 9A. | Controls and Procedures |\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  |  |\n| (a) | Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures |\n\nOur management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K were effective in providing reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission’s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures.\n\nOur management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal controls will prevent all error and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within Netflix have been detected.\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  |  |\n| (b) | Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting |\n\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as amended (the Exchange Act)). Our management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December\xa031, 2019. In making this assessment, our management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (“COSO”) in Internal Control—Integrated Framework (2013 framework). Based on our assessment under the framework in Internal Control—Integrated Framework (2013 framework), our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December\xa031, 2019. The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December\xa031, 2019 has been audited by Ernst & Young LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report that is included herein.\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  |  |\n| (c) | Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting |\n\nThere was no change in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended December\xa031, 2019 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\n\n32', 'Table of Contents\n\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\n\nTo the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of Netflix, Inc.\n\nOpinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\n\nWe have audited Netflix, Inc.’s internal control over financial reporting as of December\xa031, 2019, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). In our opinion, Netflix, Inc. (the Company) maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December\xa031, 2019, based on the COSO criteria.\n\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of December\xa031, 2019 and 2018, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, stockholders’ equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December\xa031, 2019, and the related notes and our report dated January\xa029, 2020 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.\n\nBasis for Opinion\n\nThe Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\n\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.\n\nOur audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\n\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\n\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\n\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  | |\n|  |  |\n|  | /s/ Ernst & Young LLP |\n| San Jose, California |  |\n| January\xa029, 2020 |  |\n\n33', 'Table of Contents\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  |  |\n| Item 9B. | Other Information |\n\nNone.\n\n34', 'Table of Contents\n\nPART III\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  |  |\n| Item 10. | Directors, Executive Officers and Corporate Governance |\n\nInformation regarding our directors and executive officers is incorporated by reference from the information contained under the sections “Proposal One: Election of Directors,” “Section 16(a) Beneficial Ownership Compliance” and “Code of Ethics” in our Proxy Statement for the Annual Meeting of Stockholders.\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  |  |\n| Item 11. | Executive Compensation |\n\nInformation required by this item is incorporated by reference from information contained under the section “Compensation of Executive Officers and Other Matters” in our Proxy Statement for the Annual Meeting of Stockholders.\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  |  |\n| Item 12. | Security Ownership of Certain Beneficial Owners and Management and Related Stockholder Matters |\n\nInformation required by this item is incorporated by reference from information contained under the sections “Security Ownership of Certain Beneficial Owners and Management” and “Equity Compensation Plan Information” in our Proxy Statement for the Annual Meeting of Stockholders.\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  |  |\n| Item 13. | Certain Relationships and Related Transactions, and Director Independence |\n\nInformation required by this item is incorporated by reference from information contained under the section “Certain Relationships and Related Transactions” and “Director Independence” in our Proxy Statement for the Annual Meeting of Stockholders.\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  |  |\n| Item 14. | Principal Accounting Fees and Services |\n\nInformation with respect to principal independent registered public accounting firm fees and services is incorporated by reference from the information under the caption “Proposal Two: Ratification of Appointment of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm” in our Proxy Statement for the Annual Meeting of Stockholders.\n\n35', 'Table of Contents\n\nPART IV\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  |  |\n| Item 15. | Exhibits, Financial Statement Schedules |\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  |  |\n| (a) | The following documents are filed as part of this Annual Report on Form 10-K: |\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  |  |\n| (1) | Financial Statements: |\n\nThe financial statements are filed as part of this Annual Report on Form 10-K under “Item 8.

(the Company) as of December\xa031, 2019 and 2018, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, stockholders’ equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December\xa031, 2019, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements"). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at December\xa031, 2019 and 2018, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December\xa031, 2019, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.\n\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December\xa031, 2019, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) and our report dated January\xa029, 2020 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.\n\nAdoption of ASU No. 2016-02\n\nAs discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company changed its method of accounting for leases in 2019 due to the adoption of Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842), and the related amendments.\n\nBasis for Opinion\n\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\n\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\n\nCritical Audit Matter\n\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective or complex judgments. The communication of the critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\n\n39', 'Table of Contents\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  | |\n|  |  |\n|  | Content Amortization |\n| Description of the Matter | As disclosed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements "Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies", the Company acquires, licenses and produces content, including original programming ("Streaming Content"). The Company amortizes Streaming Content based on factors including historical and estimated viewing patterns.    Auditing the amortization of the Company\'s Streaming Content is complex and subjective due to the judgmental nature of amortization which is based on an estimate of future viewing patterns. Estimated viewing patterns are based on historical and forecasted viewing. If actual viewing patterns differ from these estimates, the pattern and/or period of amortization would be changed and could affect the timing of recognition of content amortization. |\n|  |  |\n| How We Addressed the  Matter in Our Audit | We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over the content amortization process. For example, we tested controls over management\'s review of the content amortization method and the significant assumptions, including the historical and forecasted viewing hour consumption, used to develop estimated viewing patterns. We also tested management\'s controls to determine that the data used in the model was complete and accurate.    To test content amortization, our audit procedures included, among others, evaluating the content amortization method, testing the significant assumptions used to develop the estimated viewing patterns and testing the completeness and accuracy of the underlying data. For example, we assessed management\'s assumptions by comparing them to current viewing trends and current operating information including comparing previous estimates of viewing patterns to actual results. We also performed sensitivity analyses to evaluate the potential changes in the content amortization recorded that could result from changes in the assumptions. |\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  | |\n|

|\n|  |  |\n| 1. | Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies |\n\nDescription of Business\n\nNetflix, Inc. (the “Company”) was incorporated on August\xa029, 1997 and began operations on April\xa014, 1998. The Company is the world’s leading subscription streaming entertainment service with over 167 million paid streaming memberships in over 190 countries enjoying TV series, documentaries and feature films across a wide variety of genres and languages. Members can watch as much as they want, anytime, anywhere, on any internet-connected screen. Members can play, pause and resume watching, all without commercials. Additionally, over two million members in the United States ("U.S.") subscribe to our legacy DVD-by-mail service.\n\nBasis of Presentation\n\nThe consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. Intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated.\n\nReclassification\n\nCertain prior period amounts in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows and the Consolidated Balance Sheets have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation. In the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows, the amortization of DVD content assets has been reclassified into "Other non-cash items" within "Cash flows from operating activities". In addition, cash flows from the acquisition of DVD content assets have been reclassified into "Change in other assets" within "Cash flows from investing activities". In the Consolidated Balance Sheets, DVD content assets have been reclassified from "Non-current content assets, net" to "Other non-current assets" and DVD content liabilities have been reclassified from "Current content liabilities" and "Non-current content liabilities" to "Accrued expenses and other liabilities" and "Other non-current liabilities", respectively. There is no change to consolidated operating income, net income or cash flows as a result of this change in classification.\n\nUse of Estimates\n\nThe preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Significant items subject to such estimates and assumptions include the streaming content asset amortization policy and the recognition and measurement of income tax assets and liabilities. The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that the Company believes to be reasonable under the circumstances. On an ongoing basis, the Company evaluates these assumptions, judgments and estimates. Actual results may differ from these estimates.\n\nRecently adopted accounting pronouncements\n\nIn February 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued ASU 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842) in order to increase transparency and comparability among organizations by recognizing lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet for those leases classified as operating leases under prior GAAP. ASU 2016-02 requires that a lessee should recognize a liability to make lease payments (the lease liability) and a right-of-use asset representing its right to use the underlying asset for the lease term on the balance sheet. The Company adopted ASU 2016-02 in the first quarter of 2019 utilizing the modified retrospective transition method through a cumulative-effect adjustment at the beginning of the first quarter of 2019. The Company has elected the\xa0package\xa0of\xa0practical\xa0expedients, which allows the Company not to reassess (1) whether any expired or existing contracts as of the adoption date are or contain a lease, (2) lease classification for any expired or existing leases as of the adoption date and (3) initial direct costs for any existing leases as of the adoption date. The Company did not elect to apply the hindsight practical expedient when determining lease term and assessing impairment of right-of-use assets. The adoption of ASU 2016-02 on January 1, 2019 resulted in the recognition of right-of-use assets of approximately $743 million, lease liabilities for operating leases of approximately $813 million and a cumulative-effect adjustment on retained earnings of $2 million on its Consolidated Balance Sheets, with no material impact to its Consolidated Statements of Operations. See Note 3 for further information regarding the impact of the adoption of ASU 2016-02 on the Company\'s financial statements.\n\nIn March 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019-02, Improvements to Accounting for Costs of Films and License Agreements for Program Materials, in order to align the accounting for production costs of an episodic television series with the accounting for production costs of films by removing the content distinction for capitalization. ASU 2019-02 also requires that an entity\n\n46', 'Table of Contents\n\nreassess estimates of the use of a film in a film group and account for any changes prospectively. In addition, ASU 2019-02 requires that an entity test films and license agreements for program material for impairment at a film group level when the film or license agreements are predominantly monetized with other films and license agreements. ASU 2019-02 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019 and early adoption is permitted. The Company early adopted ASU 2019-02 in the first quarter of 2019 and as such has included all content assets (licensed and produced) as "Non-current content assets, net" on its Consolidated Balance Sheets, beginning with the period of adoption. There was no material impact to its Consolidated Statements of Operations. See the Company\'s updated Streaming Content policy below for further details.\n\nRecently issued accounting pronouncements not yet adopted\n\nIn June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments—Credit Losses (Topic 326), in order to improve financial reporting of expected credit losses on financial instruments and other commitments to extend credit. ASU 2016-13 requires that an entity measure and recognize expected credit losses for financial assets held at amortized cost and replaces the incurred loss impairment methodology in current GAAP with a methodology that requires consideration of a broader range of information to estimate credit losses. While the Company is continuing to assess the potential impacts of ASU 2016-13, it does not expect ASU 2016-13 to have a material effect on its financial statements.\n\nCash Equivalents\n\nThe Company considers investments in instruments purchased with an original maturity of 90 days or less to be cash equivalents. The Company also classifies amounts in transit from payment processors for customer credit card and debit card transactions as cash equivalents.\n\nStreaming Content\n\nThe Company acquires, licenses and produces content, including original programming, in order to offer members unlimited viewing of TV series and films. The content licenses are for a fixed fee and specific windows of availability. Payment terms for certain content licenses and the production of content require more upfront cash payments relative to the amortization expense. Payments for content, including additions to streaming assets and the changes in related liabilities, are classified within "Net cash used in operating activities" on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.\n\nThe Company recognizes content assets (licensed and produced) as “Non-current content assets, net” on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. For licenses, the Company capitalizes the fee per title and records a corresponding liability at the gross amount of the liability when the license period begins, the cost of the title is known and the title is accepted and available for streaming. For productions, the Company capitalizes costs associated with the production, including development costs, direct costs and production overhead. Participations and residuals are expensed in line with the amortization of production costs.\n\nBased on factors including historical and estimated viewing patterns, the Company amortizes the content assets (licensed and produced) in “Cost of revenues” on the Consolidated Statements of Operations over the shorter of each title\'s contractual window of availability or estimated period of use or ten years, beginning with the month of first availability. The amortization is on an accelerated basis, as the Company typically expects more upfront viewing, for instance due to additional merchandising and marketing efforts and film amortization is more accelerated than TV series amortization. On average, over 90% of a licensed or produced streaming content asset is expected to be amortized within four years after its month of first availability. The Company reviews factors impacting the amortization of the content assets on an ongoing basis. The Company\'s estimates related to these factors require considerable management judgment.\n\nThe Company\'s business model is subscription based as opposed to a model generating revenues at a specific title level. Content assets (licensed and produced) are predominantly monetized as a group and therefore are reviewed in aggregate at a group level when an event or change in circumstances indicates a change in the expected usefulness of the content or that the fair value may be less than unamortized cost. To date, the Company has not identified any such event or changes in circumstances. If such changes are identified in the future, these aggregated content assets will be stated at the lower of unamortized cost or fair value. In addition, unamortized costs for assets that have been, or are expected to be, abandoned are written off.\n\nProperty and Equipment\n\nProperty and equipment are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method over the shorter of the estimated useful lives of the respective assets, generally up to 30 years, or the expected lease term for leasehold improvements, if applicable.\n\n47', "Table of Contents\n\nTrade Receivables\n\nTrade receivables consist primarily of amounts related to members and payment partners that collect membership fees on the Company's behalf. The Company evaluates the need for an allowance for doubtful accounts based on historical collection trends, the financial condition of its payment partners, and external market factors.\n\nRevenue Recognition\n\nThe Company's primary source of revenues is from monthly membership fees. Members are billed in advance of the start of their monthly membership and revenues are recognized ratably over each monthly membership period. Revenues are presented net of the taxes that are collected from members and remitted to governmental authorities. The Company is the principal in all its relationships where partners, including consumer electronics (“CE”) manufacturers, multichannel video programming distributors (“MVPDs”), mobile operators and internet service providers (“ISPs”), provide access to the service as the Company retains control over service delivery to its members. Typically, payments made to the partners, such as for marketing, are expensed, but in the case where the price that the member pays is established by the partners and there is no standalone price for the Netflix service (for instance, in a bundle), these payments are recognized as a reduction of revenues.\n\nThe following tables summarize streaming revenue, paid net membership additions, and ending paid memberships by region for the years December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively:\n\nUnited States and Canada (UCAN)\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | | | | | | | | | | | | |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|  |  | As of/ Year Ended December 31, | | | | | | | | | | |\n|  |  | 2019 | | |  | 2018 | | |  | 2017 | | |\n|  |  | (in thousands) | | | | | | | | | | |\n| Revenues |  | $ | 10,051,208 |  |  | $ | 8,281,532 |  |  | $ | 6,660,859 |  |\n| Paid net membership additions |  | 2,905 | |  |  | 6,335 | |  |  | 5,512 | |  |\n| Paid memberships at end of period |  | 67,662 | |  |  | 64,757 | |  |  | 58,422 | |  |\n\nEurope, Middle East, and Africa (EMEA)\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | | | | | | | | | | | | |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|  |  | As of/ Year Ended December 31, | | | | | | | | | | |\n|  |  | 2019 | | |  | 2018 | | |  | 2017 | | |\n|  |  | (in thousands) | | | | | | | | | | |\n| Revenues |  | $ | 5,543,067 |  |  | $ | 3,963,707 |  |  | $ | 2,362,813 |  |\n| Paid net membership additions |  | 13,960 | |  |  | 11,814 | |  |  | 8,173 | |  |\n| Paid memberships at end of period |  | 51,778 | |  |  | 37,818 | |  |  | 26,004 | |  |\n\nLatin America (LATAM)\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | | | | | | | | | | | | |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|  |  | As of/ Year Ended December 31, | | | | | | | | | | |\n|  |  | 2019 | | |  | 2018 | | |  | 2017 | | |\n|  |  | (in thousands) | | | | | | | | | | |\n| Revenues |  | $ | 2,795,434 |  |  | $ | 2,237,697 |  |  | $ | 1,642,616 |  |\n| Paid net membership additions |  | 5,340 | |  |  | 6,360 | |  |  | 5,509 | |  |\n| Paid memberships at end of period |  | 31,417 | |  |  | 26,077 | |  |  | 19,717 | |  |\n\n48", "Table of Contents\n\nAsia-Pacific (APAC)\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | | | | | | | | | | | | |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|  |  | As of/ Year Ended December 31, | | | | | | | | | | |\n|  |  | 2019 | | |  | 2018 | | |  | 2017 | | |\n|  |  | (in thousands) | | | | | | | | | | |\n| Revenues |  | $ | 1,469,521 |  |  | $ | 945,816 |  |  | $ | 575,928 |  |\n| Paid net membership additions |  | 5,626 | |  |  | 4,106 | |  |  | 2,360 | |  |\n| Paid memberships at end of period |  | 16,233 | |  |  | 10,607 | |  |  | 6,501 | |  |\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n|  |\n|  |\n| A paid membership (also referred to as a paid subscription) is defined as a membership that has the right to receive Netflix service following sign-up and a method of payment being provided, and that is not part of a free trial or other promotional offering by the Company to certain new and rejoining members. A membership is canceled and ceases to be reflected in the above metrics as of the effective cancellation date. Voluntary cancellations generally become effective at the end of the prepaid membership period. Involuntary cancellation of the service, as a result of a failed method of payment, becomes effective immediately. Memberships are assigned to territories based on the geographic location used at time of sign-up as determined by the Company’s internal systems, which utilize industry standard geo-location technology. |\n\nTotal U.S. revenues, inclusive of DVD revenues not reported in the tables above, were $9.5 billion, $8.0 billion and $6.6 billion for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. DVD revenues were $0.3 billion, $0.4 billion, and $0.5 billion for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively.\n\nDeferred revenue consists of membership fees billed that have not been recognized, as well as gift and other prepaid memberships that have not been fully redeemed. As of December 31, 2019, total deferred revenue was $925 million, the vast majority of which was related to membership fees billed that are expected to be recognized as revenue within the next month. The remaining deferred revenue balance, which is related to gift cards and other prepaid memberships, will be recognized as revenue over the period of service after redemption, which is expected to occur over the next 12 months. The $164 million increase in deferred revenue as compared to the balance of $761 million for the year ended December\xa031, 2018, is a result of the increase in membership fees billed due to increased memberships and average monthly revenue per paying memberships.\n\nMarketing\n\nMarketing expenses consist primarily of advertising expenses and certain payments made to the Company’s partners, including CE manufacturers, MVPDs, mobile operators and ISPs. Advertising expenses include promotional activities such as digital and television advertising. Advertising costs are expensed as incurred. Advertising expenses were $1,879 million, $1,808 million and $1,091 million for the years ended December\xa031, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Marketing expenses also include payroll and related expenses for personnel that support the Company's marketing activities.\n\nResearch and Development\n\nResearch and development expenses consist of payroll and related costs incurred in making improvements to our service offerings. Research and development expenses were $1,673 million, $1,218 million and $981 million for the years ended December\xa031, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively.\n\nIncome Taxes\n\nThe Company records a provision for income taxes for the anticipated tax consequences of the reported results of operations using the asset and liability method. Deferred income taxes are recognized by applying enacted statutory tax rates applicable to future years to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases as well as net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. The measurement of deferred tax assets is reduced, if necessary, by a valuation allowance for any tax benefits for which future realization is uncertain.\n\nThe Company did not recognize certain tax benefits from uncertain tax positions within the provision for income taxes. The Company may recognize a tax benefit only if it is more likely than not the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such positions are then measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon settlement. The Company recognizes interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions in income tax expense. See Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements for further information regarding income taxes.\n\n49", 'Table of Contents\n\nForeign Currency\n\nThe functional currency for the Company\'s subsidiaries is determined based on the primary economic environment in which the subsidiary operates. The Company translates the assets and liabilities of its non-U.S. dollar functional currency subsidiaries into U.S. dollars using exchange rates in effect at the end of each period. Revenues and expenses for these subsidiaries are translated using rates that approximate those in effect during the period. Gains and losses from these translations are recognized in cumulative translation adjustment included in "Accumulated other comprehensive loss" in Stockholders’ equity on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\n\nThe Company remeasures monetary assets and liabilities that are not denominated in the functional currency at exchange rates in effect at the end of each period. Gains and losses from these remeasurements are recognized in interest and other income (expense).  Foreign currency transactions resulted in a gain of $7 million for the year ended December\xa031, 2019, and in a loss of $1 million and $128 million for the years ended December\xa031, 2018 and 2017, respectively.\n\nEarnings Per Share\n\nBasic earnings per share is computed using the weighted-average number of outstanding shares of common stock during the period. Diluted earnings per share is computed using the weighted-average number of outstanding shares of common stock and, when dilutive, potential common shares outstanding during the period. Potential common shares consist of incremental shares issuable upon the assumed exercise of stock options. The computation of earnings per share is as follows:\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | | | | | | | | | | | |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|  | Year ended December\xa031, | | | | | | | | | | |\n|  | 2019 | | |  | 2018 | | |  | 2017 | | |\n|  | (in\xa0thousands,\xa0except\xa0per\xa0share\xa0data) | | | | | | | | | | |\n| Basic earnings per share: |  | | |  |  | | |  |  | | |\n| Net income | $ | 1,866,916 |  |  | $ | 1,211,242 |  |  | $ | 558,929 |  |\n| Shares used in computation: |  | | |  |  | | |  |  | | |\n| Weighted-average common shares outstanding | 437,799 | |  |  | 435,374 | |  |  | 431,885 | |  |\n| Basic earnings per share | $ | 4.26 |  |  | $ | 2.78 |  |  | $ | 1.29 |  |\n| Diluted earnings per share: |  | | |  |  | | |  |  | | |\n| Net income | $ | 1,866,916 |  |  | $ | 1,211,242 |  |  | $ | 558,929 |  |\n| Shares used in computation: |  | | |  |  | | |  |  | | |\n| Weighted-average common shares outstanding | 437,799 | |  |  | 435,374 | |  |  | 431,885 | |  |\n| Employee stock options | 13,966 | |  |  | 15,870 | |  |  | 14,929 | |  |\n| Weighted-average number of shares | 451,765 | |  |  | 451,244 | |  |  | 446,814 | |  |\n| Diluted earnings per share | $ | 4.13 |  |  | $ | 2.68 |  |  | $ | 1.25 |  |\n\nEmployee stock options with exercise prices greater than the average market price of the common stock were excluded from the diluted calculation as their inclusion would have been anti-dilutive.

These leases generally have terms which range from 1 year to 15 years, and often include one or more options to renew. These renewal terms can extend the lease term from 1 year to 15 years, and are included in the lease term when it is reasonably certain that the Company will exercise the option. These operating leases are included in "Other non-current assets" on the Company\'s December\xa031, 2019 Consolidated Balance Sheets, and represent the Company’s right to use the underlying asset for the lease term. The Company’s obligations to make lease payments are included in "Accrued expenses and other liabilities" and "Other non-current liabilities" on the Company\'s December\xa031, 2019 Consolidated Balance Sheets. \xa0Based on the present value of the lease payments for the remaining lease term of the Company\'s existing leases, the Company recognized right-of-use assets of approximately $743 million and lease liabilities for operating leases of approximately $813 million on January 1, 2019. Operating lease right-of-use assets and liabilities commencing after January 1, 2019 are recognized at commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. As of December\xa031, 2019, total right-of-use assets and operating lease liabilities were approximately $1,532 million and $1,613 million, respectively. The Company has entered into various short-term operating leases, primarily for marketing billboards, with an initial term of twelve months or less. These leases are not recorded on the Company\'s Consolidated Balance Sheets. All operating lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. For the year ended December\xa031, 2019, the Company recognized approximately $448 million in total lease costs, which was comprised of $218 million in operating lease costs for right-of-use assets and $230 million in short-term lease costs related to short-term operating leases.\n\nPrior to the adoption of ASU 2016-02 in the first quarter of 2019, the Company recognized minimum rental expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term. The Company used the date of initial possession to begin amortization, which is generally when the Company entered the space and began to make improvements in preparation for intended use. For scheduled rent escalation clauses during the lease terms or for rental payments commencing at a date other than the date of initial occupancy, the Company recorded minimum rental expenses on a straight-line basis over the terms of the leases in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Rent expense associated with operating leases was $107 million and $75 million for the years ended December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively.\n\nBecause the rate implicit in each lease is not readily determinable, the Company uses its incremental borrowing rate to determine the present value of the lease payments. The Company has certain contracts for real estate and marketing which may contain lease and non-lease components which it has elected to treat as a single lease component.\n\nInformation related to the Company\'s right-of-use assets and related lease liabilities were as follows:\n\n|  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | | | |\n|  |  |  |  |\n|  | Year ended December 31, | | |\n|  | 2019 | | |\n|  | (in thousands) | | |\n| Cash paid for operating lease liabilities | $ | 192,084 |  |\n| Right-of-use assets obtained in exchange for new operating lease obligations (1) | 1,672,462 | |  |\n\n53', "Table of Contents\n\n(1) Balance includes $743 million for operating leases existing on January 1, 2019.\n\n|  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|  | | |\n|  |  |  |\n|  | As of | |\n|  | December\xa031, 2019 | |\n|  |  | |\n| Weighted-average remaining lease term | 8.8 years |  |\n| Weighted-average discount rate | 5.0 | % |\n\nMaturities of lease liabilities as of December\xa031, 2019 were as follows (in thousands):\n\n|  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | | | |\n|  |  |  |  |\n| Due in 12 month period ended December 31, | | | |\n| 2020 | $ | 248,636 |  |\n| 2021 | 246,148 | |  |\n| 2022 | 226,020 | |  |\n| 2023 | 211,387 | |  |\n| 2024 | 194,506 | |  |\n| Thereafter | 912,457 | |  |\n|  | 2,039,154 | |  |\n| Less imputed interest | (425,920 | | ) |\n| Total lease liabilities | 1,613,234 | |  |\n|  |  | | |\n| Current operating lease liabilities | 190,622 | |  |\n| Non-current operating lease liabilities | 1,422,612 | |  |\n| Total lease liabilities | $ | 1,613,234 |  |\n\nThe Company has additional operating leases for real estate of $699 million which have not commenced as of December\xa031, 2019, and as such, have not been recognized on the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets.

The Notes include, among other terms and conditions, limitations on the Company\'s ability to create,\n\n55', 'Table of Contents\n\nincur or allow certain liens; enter into sale and lease-back transactions; create, assume, incur or guarantee additional indebtedness of certain of the Company\'s subsidiaries; and consolidate or merge with, or convey, transfer or lease all or substantially all of the Company\'s and its subsidiaries assets, to another person. As of December\xa031, 2019 and December\xa031, 2018, the Company was in compliance with all related covenants.\n\nRevolving Credit\xa0Facility\n\nIn July 2017, the Company entered into a\xa0$500 million\xa0unsecured revolving credit\xa0facility (“Revolving Credit Agreement”), with an uncommitted incremental facility to increase the amount of the revolving credit facility by up to an additional\xa0$250 million, subject to certain terms and conditions. On March 29, 2019, the agreement was amended to extend the maturity date from July 27, 2022 to March 29, 2024 and to increase the size of the credit facility to $750 million, without impacting the existing uncommitted incremental facility. Revolving loans may be borrowed, repaid and reborrowed until March 29, 2024, at which time all amounts borrowed must be repaid. The Company may use the proceeds of future borrowings under the Revolving Credit Agreement for working capital and general corporate purposes. As of\xa0December\xa031, 2019, no amounts have been borrowed under the Revolving Credit Agreement.\n\nThe borrowings under the Revolving Credit Agreement bear interest, at the Company’s option, of either (i) a floating rate equal to a base rate (the “Alternate Base Rate”) or (ii) a rate equal to an adjusted London interbank offered rate (the “Adjusted LIBO Rate”), plus a margin of\xa00.75%. The Alternate Base Rate is defined as the greatest of (A) the rate of interest published by the Wall Street Journal, from time to time, as the prime rate, (B) the federal funds rate, plus\xa00.500%\xa0and (C) the Adjusted LIBO Rate for a one-month interest period, plus\xa01.00%. The Adjusted LIBO Rate is defined as the London interbank offered rate for deposits in U.S. dollars, for the relevant interest period, adjusted for statutory reserve requirements, but in no event shall the Adjusted LIBO Rate be less than\xa00.00%\xa0per annum. Regulatory authorities that oversee financial markets have announced that after the end of 2021, they would no longer compel banks currently reporting information used to set the LIBO Rate to continue to make rate submissions. As a result, it is possible that beginning in 2022, the LIBO Rate will no longer be available as a reference rate. Under the terms of the Company\'s Revolving Credit Agreement, in the event of the discontinuance of the LIBO Rate, a mutually agreed-upon alternate benchmark rate will be established to replace the LIBO Rate. The Company and Lenders shall in good faith establish an alternate benchmark rate which places the Lenders and the Company in the same economic position that existed immediately prior to the discontinuation of the LIBO Rate. The Company does not anticipate that the discontinuance of the LIBO Rate will materially impact its liquidity or financial position.\n\nThe Company is also obligated to pay a commitment fee on the undrawn amounts of the Revolving Credit Agreement at an annual rate of\xa00.10%. The Revolving Credit Agreement requires the Company to comply with certain covenants, including covenants that limit or restrict the ability of the Company’s subsidiaries to incur debt and limit or restrict the ability of the Company and its subsidiaries to grant liens and enter into sale and leaseback transactions; and, in the case of the Company or a guarantor, merge, consolidate, liquidate, dissolve or sell, transfer, lease or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole.

Obligations that are in non-U.S. dollar currencies are translated to the U.S. dollar at period end rates. An obligation for the production of content includes non-cancelable commitments under creative talent and employment agreements as well as other production related commitments. An obligation for the acquisition and licensing of content is incurred at the time the Company enters into an agreement to obtain future titles. Once a title becomes available, a content liability is recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Certain agreements include the obligation to license rights for unknown future titles, the ultimate quantity and/or fees for which are not yet determinable as of the reporting date. Traditional film output deals, or certain TV series license agreements where the number of seasons to be aired is unknown, are examples of such license agreements. The Company does not include any estimated obligation for these future titles beyond the known minimum amount. However, the unknown obligations are expected to be significant.\n\nLegal Proceedings\n\nFrom time to time, in the normal course of its operations, the Company is subject to litigation matters and claims, including claims relating to employee relations, business practices and patent infringement. Litigation can be expensive and disruptive to normal business operations. Moreover, the results of complex legal proceedings are difficult to predict and the Company's view of these matters may change in the future as the litigation and events related thereto unfold. The Company expenses legal fees as incurred. The Company records a provision for contingent losses when it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. An unfavorable outcome to any legal matter, if material, could have an adverse effect on the Company's operations or its financial position, liquidity or results of operations.\n\nThe Company is involved in litigation matters not listed herein but does not consider the matters to be material either individually or in the aggregate at this time. The Company's view of the matters not listed may change in the future as the litigation and events related thereto unfold.\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  |  |\n| 6. | Guarantees—Indemnification Obligations |\n\nIn the ordinary course of business, the Company has entered into contractual arrangements under which it has agreed to provide indemnification of varying scope and terms to business partners and other parties with respect to certain matters, including, but not limited to, losses arising out of the Company’s breach of such agreements and out of intellectual property infringement claims made by third parties. In these circumstances, payment may be conditional on the other party making a claim pursuant to the procedures specified in the particular contract.\n\nThe Company’s obligations under these agreements may be limited in terms of time or amount, and in some instances, the Company may have recourse against third parties for certain payments. In addition, the Company has entered into indemnification agreements with its directors and certain of its officers that will require it, among other things, to indemnify them against certain liabilities that may arise by reason of their status or service as directors or officers. The terms of such obligations vary.\n\nIt is not possible to make a reasonable estimate of the maximum potential amount of future payments under these or similar agreements due to the conditional nature of the Company’s obligations and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular agreement. No amount has been accrued in the accompanying consolidated financial statements with respect to these indemnification guarantees.\n\n57", 'Table of Contents\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  |  |\n| 7. | Stockholders’ Equity |\n\nVoting Rights\n\nThe holders of each share of common stock shall be entitled to one vote per share on all matters to be voted upon by the Company’s stockholders.\n\nStock Option Plans\n\nIn June 2011, the Company adopted the 2011 Stock Plan.

This amount changes based on the fair market value of the Company’s common stock.

The Company believes that implied volatility of publicly traded options in its common stock is more reflective of market conditions, and given consistently high trade volumes of the options, can reasonably be expected to be a better indicator of expected volatility than historical volatility of its common stock.\n\nIn valuing shares issued under the Company’s employee stock option plans, the Company bases the risk-free interest rate on U.S. Treasury zero-coupon issues with terms similar to the contractual term of the options. The Company does not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future and therefore uses an expected dividend yield of\xa0zero\xa0in the option valuation model. The Company does not use a post-vesting termination rate as options are fully vested upon grant date.\n\nAccumulated Other Comprehensive Loss\n\nThe following table summarizes the changes in accumulated balances of other comprehensive loss, net of tax:\n\n|  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | | | |\n|  |  |  |  |\n|  | Foreign currency | | |\n|  | (in thousands) | | |\n| Balances as of December 31, 2017 | $ | (20,557 | ) |\n| Other comprehensive income before reclassifications | 975 | |  |\n| Net decrease in accumulated other comprehensive loss | 975 | |  |\n| Balances as of December 31, 2018 | $ | (19,582 | ) |\n| Other comprehensive loss before reclassifications | (3,939 | | ) |\n| Net increase in accumulated other comprehensive loss | (3,939 | | ) |\n| Balances as of December 31, 2019 | $ | (23,521 | ) |\n\n59', 'Table of Contents\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  |  |\n| 8. | Income Taxes |\n\nIncome before provision for income taxes was as follows:\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | | | | | | | | | | | |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|  | Year Ended December\xa031, | | | | | | | | | | |\n|  | 2019 | | |  | 2018 | | |  | 2017 | | |\n|  | (in thousands) | | | | | | | | | | |\n| United States | $ | 1,719,326 |  |  | $ | 845,402 |  |  | $ | 144,100 |  |\n| Foreign | 342,905 | |  |  | 381,056 | |  |  | 341,221 | |  |\n| Income before income taxes | $ | 2,062,231 |  |  | $ | 1,226,458 |  |  | $ | 485,321 |  |\n\nThe components of provision for (benefit from) income taxes for all periods presented were as follows:\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | | | | | | | | | | | |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|  | Year Ended December\xa031, | | | | | | | | | | |\n|  | 2019 | | |  | 2018 | | |  | 2017 | | |\n|  | (in thousands) | | | | | | | | | | |\n| Current tax provision: |  | | |  |  | | |  |  | | |\n| Federal | $ | 21,498 |  |  | $ | (22,176 | ) |  | $ | 54,245 |  |\n| State | 45,228 | |  |  | (10,234 | | ) |  | (7,601 | | ) |\n| Foreign | 223,328 | |  |  | 133,146 | |  |  | 88,436 | |  |\n| Total current | 290,054 | |  |  | 100,736 | |  |  | 135,080 | |  |\n| Deferred tax provision: |  | | |  |  | | |  |  | | |\n| Federal | (28,003 | | ) |  | (37,396 | | ) |  | (153,963 | | ) |\n| State | (54,507 | | ) |  | (52,391 | | ) |  | (52,695 | | ) |\n| Foreign | (12,229 | | ) |  | 4,267 | |  |  | (2,030 | | ) |\n| Total deferred | (94,739 | | ) |  | (85,520 | | ) |  | (208,688 | | ) |\n| Provision for (benefit from) income taxes | $ | 195,315 |  |  | $ | 15,216 |  |  | $ | (73,608 | ) |\n\nIn connection with the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 the Company simplified its global corporate structure, effective April 1, 2019.

Interest and penalties included in the Company\'s provision for income taxes were not material in all the periods presented.\n\nThe Company files U.S. Federal, state and foreign tax returns. The Company is currently under examination by the IRS for 2016, 2017, and 2018. The 2009 through 2018 state tax returns are subject to examination by state tax authorities. The Company is also currently under examination in the UK for 2018. The company has no other significant foreign jurisdiction audits underway. The years 2014 through 2018 remain subject to examination by foreign tax authorities.\n\nGiven the potential outcome of the current examinations as well as the impact of the current examinations on the potential expiration of the statute of limitations, it is reasonably possible that the balance of unrecognized tax benefits could significantly change within the next twelve months.

Because the Company increasingly obtains multi-territory or global rights for streaming content, contribution profit (loss) on a regional basis is no longer a meaningful metric reviewed by the CODM or used in the allocation of resources. Instead, the CODM now focuses on the Company\'s global operating margin as the primary measure of profitability and basis for allocation of resources.\n\nTotal U.S. revenues were $9.5 billion, $8.0 billion and $6.6 billion for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively.

(“Netflix”, “the Company”, “we”, or “us”) is the world’s leading internet entertainment service with over 139 million paid memberships in over 190 countries enjoying TV series, documentaries and feature films across a wide variety of genres and languages. Members can watch as much as they want, anytime, anywhere, on any internet-connected screen. Members can play, pause and resume watching, all without commercials or commitments. Additionally, over two million members in the United States ("U.S.") subscribe to our legacy DVD-by-mail service.\n\nWe are a pioneer in the internet delivery of TV series and movies, launching our streaming service in 2007. Since this launch, we have developed an ecosystem for internet-connected screens and have added increasing amounts of content that enable consumers to enjoy TV series and movies directly on their internet-connected screens. As a result of these efforts, we have experienced growing consumer acceptance of, and interest in, the delivery of TV series and movies directly over the internet.\n\nOur core strategy is to grow our streaming membership business globally within the parameters of our operating margin target. We are continuously improving our members\' experience by expanding our streaming content with a focus on a programming mix of content that delights our members and attracts new members. In addition, we are continuously enhancing our user interface and extending our streaming service to more internet-connected screens. Our members can download a selection of titles for offline viewing.\n\nBUSINESS SEGMENTS\n\nThe Company has three reportable segments: Domestic streaming, International streaming and Domestic DVD. The Domestic streaming segment derives revenues from monthly membership fees for services related to streaming content to members in the United States. The International streaming segment derives revenues from monthly membership fees for services related to streaming content to members outside of the United States. The Domestic DVD segment derives revenues from monthly membership fees for services consisting solely of DVD-by-mail.\n\nCOMPETITION\n\nThe market for entertainment video is intensely competitive and subject to rapid change. We compete against other entertainment video providers, such as multichannel video programming distributors ("MVPDs"), internet-based content providers (including those that provide pirated content), video gaming providers and DVD retailers and more broadly against other sources of entertainment that our members could choose in their moments of free time. We also compete against entertainment video providers and content producers in obtaining content for our service, both for licensed streaming content and for original content projects.\n\nWhile consumers may maintain simultaneous relationships with multiple entertainment sources, we strive for consumers to choose us in their moments of free time. We have often referred to this choice as our objective of "winning moments of\n\n1', 'Table of Contents\n\ntruth." In attempting to win these moments of truth with our members, we are continually improving our service, including both our technology and our content, which is increasingly exclusive and curated, and includes our own original programming.\n\nSEASONALITY\n\nOur membership growth exhibits a seasonal pattern that reflects variations when consumers buy internet-connected screens and when they tend to increase their viewing. Historically, the first and fourth quarters (October through March) represent our greatest membership growth across our Domestic and International streaming segments. Our membership growth can sometimes be impacted by the release of certain high-profile original content. Within our International streaming segment, we expect each market to demonstrate more predictable seasonal patterns as our service offering in each market becomes more established and we have a longer history to assess such patterns.\n\nINTELLECTUAL PROPERTY\n\nWe regard our trademarks, service marks, copyrights, patents, domain names, trade dress, trade secrets, proprietary technologies and similar intellectual property as important to our success. We use a combination of patent, trademark, copyright and trade secret laws and confidentiality agreements to protect our proprietary intellectual property. Our ability to protect and enforce our intellectual property rights is subject to certain risks and from time to time we encounter disputes over rights and obligations concerning intellectual property. We cannot provide assurance that we will prevail in any intellectual property disputes.\n\nEMPLOYEES\n\nAs of December\xa031, 2018, we had approximately 7,100 full-time employees, of which approximately 6,900 supported our streaming segments.\n\nOTHER INFORMATION\n\nWe were incorporated in Delaware in August 1997 and completed our initial public offering in May 2002. Our principal executive offices are located at 100 Winchester Circle, Los Gatos, California 95032, and our telephone number is (408)\xa0540-3700.\n\nWe maintain a website at www.netflix.com. The contents of our website are not incorporated in, or otherwise to be regarded as part of, this Annual Report on Form 10-K. In this Annual Report on Form 10-K, “Netflix,” the “Company,” “we,” “us,” “our” and the “registrant” refer to Netflix, Inc. We make available, free of charge on our website, access to our Annual Report on Form 10-K, our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, our Current Reports on Form 8-K and amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), as soon as reasonably practicable after we file or furnish them electronically with the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC").\n\nInvestors and others should note that we announce material financial information to our investors using our investor relations website (http://ir.netflix.com), SEC filings, press releases, public conference calls and webcasts. We use these channels as well as social media to communicate with our members and the public about our company, our services and other issues. It is possible that the information we post on social media could be deemed to be material information. Therefore, we encourage investors, the media, and others interested in our company to review the information we post on the social media channels listed on our investor relations website.\n\n2', 'Table of Contents\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  |  |\n| Item 1A. | Risk Factors |\n\nIf any of the following risks actually occur, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be harmed. In that case, the trading price of our common stock could decline, and you could lose all or part of your investment.\n\nRisks Related to Our Business\n\nIf our efforts to attract and retain members are not successful, our business will be adversely affected.\n\nWe have experienced significant membership growth over the past several years. Our ability to continue to attract members will depend in part on our ability to consistently provide our members with compelling content choices, as well as a quality experience for selecting and viewing TV series and movies. Furthermore, the relative service levels, content offerings, pricing and related features of competitors to our service may adversely impact our ability to attract and retain memberships. Competitors include other entertainment video providers, such as MVPDs, internet-based movie and TV content providers (including those that provide pirated content) and DVD retailers. If consumers do not perceive our service offering to be of value, including if we introduce new or adjust existing features, adjust pricing or service offerings, or change the mix of content in a manner that is not favorably received by them, we may not be able to attract and retain members. In addition, many of our members rejoin our service or originate from word-of-mouth advertising from existing members. If our efforts to satisfy our existing members are not successful, we may not be able to attract members, and as a result, our ability to maintain and/or grow our business will be adversely affected. Members cancel our service for many reasons, including a perception that they do not use the service sufficiently, the need to cut household expenses, availability of content is unsatisfactory, competitive services provide a better value or experience and customer service issues are not satisfactorily resolved. We must continually add new memberships both to replace canceled memberships and to grow our business beyond our current membership base. If we do not grow as expected, given, in particular, that our content costs are largely fixed in nature and contracted over several years, we may not be able to adjust our expenditures or increase our (per membership) revenues commensurate with the lowered growth rate such that our margins, liquidity and results of operation may be adversely impacted. If we are unable to successfully compete with current and new competitors in both retaining our existing memberships and attracting new memberships, our business will be adversely affected. Further, if excessive numbers of members cancel our service, we may be required to incur significantly higher marketing expenditures than we currently anticipate to replace these members with new members.\n\nChanges in competitive offerings for entertainment video, including the potential rapid adoption of piracy-based video offerings, could adversely impact our business.\n\nThe market for entertainment video is intensely competitive and subject to rapid change. Through new and existing distribution channels, consumers have increasing options to access entertainment video. The various economic models underlying these channels include subscription, transactional, ad-supported and piracy-based models. All of these have the potential to capture meaningful segments of the entertainment video market. Piracy, in particular, threatens to damage our business, as its fundamental proposition to consumers is so compelling and difficult to compete against: virtually all content for free. Furthermore, in light of the compelling consumer proposition, piracy services are subject to rapid global growth. Traditional providers of entertainment video, including broadcasters and cable network operators, as well as internet based e-commerce or entertainment video providers are increasing their internet-based video offerings. Several of these competitors have long operating histories, large customer bases, strong brand recognition, exclusive rights to certain content and significant financial, marketing and other resources. They may secure better terms from suppliers, adopt more aggressive pricing and devote more resources to product development, technology, infrastructure, content acquisitions and marketing. New entrants may enter the market or existing providers may adjust their services with unique offerings or approaches to providing entertainment video. Companies also may enter into business combinations or alliances that strengthen their competitive positions. If we are unable to successfully or profitably compete with current and new competitors, our business will be adversely affected, and we may not be able to increase or maintain market share, revenues or profitability.\n\nThe long-term and fixed cost nature of our content commitments may limit our operating flexibility and could adversely affect our liquidity and results of operations.\n\nIn connection with licensing streaming content, we typically enter into multi-year commitments with studios and other content providers. We also enter into multi-year commitments for content that we produce, either directly or through third parties, including elements associated with these productions such as non-cancelable commitments under talent agreements. The payment terms of these agreements are not tied to member usage or the size of our membership base (“fixed cost”) but may be determined by costs of production or tied to such factors as titles licensed and/or theatrical exhibition receipts. Such commitments, to the extent estimable under accounting standards, are included in the Contractual Obligations section of Part II,\n\n3', 'Table of Contents\n\nItem 7, "Management\'s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" and Note 5, Commitments and Contingencies in the accompanying notes to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8, "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Given the multiple-year duration and largely fixed cost nature of content commitments, if membership acquisition and retention do not meet our expectations, our margins may be adversely impacted. Payment terms for certain content commitments, such as content we directly produce, will typically require more up-front cash payments than other content licenses or arrangements whereby we do not cashflow the production of such content. To the extent membership and/or revenue growth do not meet our expectations, our liquidity and results of operations could be adversely affected as a result of content commitments and accelerated payment requirements of certain agreements. In addition, the long-term and fixed cost nature of our content commitments may limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to changes in our business and the market segments in which we operate. If we license and/or produce content that is not favorably received by consumers in a territory, or is unable to be shown in a territory, acquisition and retention may be adversely impacted and given the long-term and fixed cost nature of our content commitments, we may not be able to adjust our content offering quickly and our results of operation may be adversely impacted.\n\nWe face risks, such as unforeseen costs and potential liability in connection with content we acquire, produce, license and/or distribute through our service.\n\nAs a producer and distributor of content, we face potential liability for negligence, copyright and trademark infringement, or other claims based on the nature and content of materials that we acquire, produce, license and/or distribute. We also may face potential liability for content used in promoting our service, including marketing materials. We are devoting more resources toward the development, production, marketing and distribution of original programming, including TV series and movies. We believe that original programming can help differentiate our service from other offerings, enhance our brand and otherwise attract and retain members. To the extent our original programming does not meet our expectations, in particular, in terms of costs, viewing and popularity, our business, including our brand and results of operations may be adversely impacted. As we expand our original programming, we have become responsible for production costs and other expenses, such as ongoing guild payments. We also take on risks associated with production, such as completion and key talent risk. Negotiations or renewals related to entertainment industry collective bargaining agreements could negatively impact timing and costs associated with our productions. We contract with third parties related to the development, production, marketing and distribution of our original programming.\xa0 We may face potential liability or may suffer losses in connection with these arrangements, including but not limited to if such third parties violate applicable law, become insolvent or engage in fraudulent behavior. To the extent we create and sell physical or digital merchandise relating to our original programming, and/or license such rights to third parties, we could become subject to product liability, intellectual property or other claims related to such merchandise. We may decide to remove content from our service, not to place licensed or produced content on our service or discontinue or alter production of original content if we believe such content might not be well received by our members or could be damaging to our brand or business.\n\nTo the extent we do not accurately anticipate costs or mitigate risks, including for content that we obtain but ultimately does not appear on or is removed from our service, or if we become liable for content we acquire, produce, license and/or distribute, our business may suffer. Litigation to defend these claims could be costly and the expenses and damages arising from any liability or unforeseen production risks could harm our results of operations. We may not be indemnified against claims or costs of these types and we may not have insurance coverage for these types of claims.\n\nIf studios, content providers or other rights holders refuse to license streaming content or other rights upon terms acceptable to us, our business could be adversely affected.\n\nOur ability to provide our members with content they can watch depends on studios, content providers and other rights holders licensing rights to distribute such content and certain related elements thereof, such as the public performance of music contained within the content we distribute. The license periods and the terms and conditions of such licenses vary. As content providers develop their own streaming services, they may be unwilling to provide us with access to certain content, including popular series or movies. If the studios, content providers and other rights holders are not or are no longer willing or able to license us content upon terms acceptable to us, our ability to stream content to our members will be adversely affected and/or our costs could increase. Certain licenses for content provide for the studios or other content providers to withdraw content from our service relatively quickly. Because of these provisions as well as other actions we may take, content available through our service can be withdrawn on short notice. As competition increases, we may see the cost of programming increase. As we seek to differentiate our service, we are increasingly focused on securing certain exclusive rights when obtaining content, including original content. We are also focused on programming an overall mix of content that delights our members in a cost efficient manner. Within this context, we are selective about the titles we add and renew to our service. If we do not maintain a compelling mix of content, our membership acquisition and retention may be adversely affected.\n\nMusic and certain authors’ performances contained within content we distribute may require us to obtain licenses for such distribution. In this regard, we engage in negotiations with collection management organizations (“CMOs”) that hold certain\n\n4', 'Table of Contents\n\nrights to music and/or other interests in connection with streaming content into various territories. If we are unable to reach mutually acceptable terms with these organizations, we could become involved in litigation and/or could be enjoined from distributing certain content, which could adversely impact our business. Additionally, pending and ongoing litigation as well as negotiations between certain CMOs and other third parties in various territories could adversely impact our negotiations with CMOs, or result in music publishers represented by certain CMOs unilaterally withdrawing rights, and thereby adversely impact our ability to reach licensing agreements reasonably acceptable to us. Failure to reach such licensing agreements could expose us to potential liability for copyright infringement or otherwise increase our costs. Additionally, as the market for the digital distribution of content grows, a broader role for CMOs in the remuneration of authors and performers could expose us to greater distribution expenses.\n\nIf we are not able to manage change and growth, our business could be adversely affected.\n\nWe are expanding our operations internationally, scaling our streaming service to effectively and reliably handle anticipated growth in both members and features related to our service, ramping up our ability to produce original content, as well as continuing to operate our DVD service within the U.S. As our international offering evolves, we are managing and adjusting our business to address varied content offerings, consumer customs and practices, in particular those dealing with e-commerce and internet video, as well as differing legal and regulatory environments. As we scale our streaming service, we are developing technology and utilizing third-party “cloud” computing services. As we ramp up our original content production, we are building out expertise in a number of disciplines, including creative, marketing, legal, finance, licensing, merchandising and other resources related to the development and physical production of content. If we are not able to manage the growing complexity of our business, including improving, refining or revising our systems and operational practices related to our streaming operations and original content, our business may be adversely affected.\n\nWe could be subject to economic, political, regulatory and other risks arising from our international operations.\n\nOperating in international markets requires significant resources and management attention and will subject us to economic, political, regulatory and other risks that may be different from or incremental to those in the U.S. In addition to the risks that we face in the U.S., our international operations involve risks that could adversely affect our business, including:\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  |  |\n| • | the need to adapt our content and user interfaces for specific cultural and language differences; |\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  |  |\n| • | difficulties and costs associated with staffing and managing foreign operations; |\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  |  |\n| • | political or social unrest and economic instability; |\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  |  |\n| • | compliance with laws such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, UK Bribery Act and other anti-corruption laws, export controls and economic sanctions, and local laws prohibiting corrupt payments to government officials; |\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  |  |\n| • | difficulties in understanding and complying with local laws, regulations and customs in foreign jurisdictions; |\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  |  |\n| • | regulatory requirements or government action against our service, whether in response to enforcement of actual or purported legal and regulatory requirements or otherwise, that results in disruption or non-availability of our service or particular content in the applicable jurisdiction; |\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  |  |\n| • | foreign intellectual property laws, or changes to such laws, which may be less favorable than U.S. law and, among other issues, may impact the economics of creating or distributing content, anti-piracy efforts, or our ability to protect or exploit intellectual property rights; |\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  |  |\n| • | adverse tax consequences such as those related to changes in tax laws or tax rates or their interpretations, and the related application of judgment in determining our global provision for income taxes, deferred tax assets or liabilities or other tax liabilities given the ultimate tax determination is uncertain; |\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  |  |\n| • | fluctuations in currency exchange rates, which we do not use foreign exchange contracts or derivatives to hedge against and which will impact revenues and expenses of our international operations and expose us to foreign currency exchange rate risk; |\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  |  |\n| • | profit repatriation and other restrictions on the transfer of funds; |\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  |  |\n| • | differing payment processing systems as well as consumer use and acceptance of electronic payment methods, such as payment cards; |\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  |  |\n| • | new and different sources of competition; |\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  |  |\n| • | censorship requirements that cause us to remove or edit popular content, leading to consumer disappointment or dissatisfaction with our service; |\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  |  |\n| • | low usage and/or penetration of internet-connected consumer electronic devices; |\n\n5', 'Table of Contents\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  |  |\n| • | different and more stringent user protection, data protection, privacy and other laws, including data localization requirements; |\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  |  |\n| • | availability of reliable broadband connectivity and wide area networks in targeted areas for expansion; |\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  |  |\n| • | integration and operational challenges as well as potential unknown liabilities in connection with companies we may acquire or control; |\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  |  |\n| • | differing, and often more lenient, laws and consumer understanding/attitudes regarding the illegality of piracy; and |\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  |  |\n| • | implementation of regulations designed to stimulate the local production of film and TV series in order to promote and preserve local culture and economic activity, including local content quotas, investment obligations, and levies to support local film funds. |\n\nOur failure to manage any of these risks successfully could harm our international operations and our overall business, and results of our operations.\n\nWe are subject to taxation related risks in multiple jurisdictions.\n\nWe are a U.S.-based multinational company subject to tax in multiple U.S. and foreign tax jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in determining our global provision for income taxes, deferred tax assets or liabilities and in evaluating our tax positions on a worldwide basis. While we believe our tax positions are consistent with the tax laws in the jurisdictions in which we conduct our business, it is possible that these positions may be contested or overturned by jurisdictional tax authorities, which may have a significant impact on our global provision for income taxes.\n\nTax laws are dynamic and subject to change as new laws are passed and new interpretations of the law are issued or applied. The U.S. recently enacted significant tax reform, and certain provisions of the new law may adversely affect us. In addition, governmental tax authorities are increasingly scrutinizing the tax positions of companies. Many countries in the European Union, as well as a number of other countries and organizations such as the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, are actively considering changes to existing tax laws that, if enacted, could increase our tax obligations in countries where we do business. If U.S. or other foreign tax authorities change applicable tax laws, our overall taxes could increase, and our business, financial condition or results of operations may be adversely impacted.\n\nIf we fail to maintain or, in newer markets establish, a positive reputation concerning our service, including the content we offer, we may not be able to attract or retain members, and our operating results may be adversely affected.\n\nWe believe that a positive reputation concerning our service is important in attracting and retaining members. To the extent our content, in particular, our original programming, is perceived as low quality, offensive or otherwise not compelling to consumers, our ability to establish and maintain a positive reputation may be adversely impacted. To the extent our content is deemed controversial or offensive by government regulators, we may face direct or indirect retaliatory action or behavior, including being required to remove such content from our service, our entire service could be banned and/or become subject to heightened regulatory scrutiny across our business and operations. Furthermore, to the extent our marketing, customer service and public relations efforts are not effective or result in negative reaction, our ability to establish and maintain a positive reputation may likewise be adversely impacted. With newer markets, we also need to establish our reputation with consumers and to the extent we are not successful in creating positive impressions, our business in these newer markets may be adversely impacted.\n\nChanges in how we market our service could adversely affect our marketing expenses and membership levels may be adversely affected.\n\nWe utilize a broad mix of marketing and public relations programs, including social media sites, to promote our service to potential new members. We may limit or discontinue use or support of certain marketing sources or activities if advertising rates increase or if we become concerned that members or potential members deem certain marketing platforms or practices intrusive or damaging to our brand. If the available marketing channels are curtailed, our ability to attract new members may be adversely affected.\n\nCompanies that promote our service may decide that we negatively impact their business or may make business decisions that in turn negatively impact us. For example, if they decide that they want to compete more directly with us, enter a similar business or exclusively support our competitors, we may no longer have access to their marketing channels. We also acquire a number of members who rejoin our service having previously cancelled their membership. If we are unable to maintain or replace our sources of members with similarly effective sources, or if the cost of our existing sources increases, our member levels and marketing expenses may be adversely affected.\n\n6', "Table of Contents\n\nWe utilize marketing to promote our content and drive viewing by our members. To the extent we promote our content inefficiently or ineffectively, we may not obtain the expected acquisition and retention benefits and our business may be adversely affected.\n\nWe rely upon a number of partners to make our service available on their devices.\n\nWe currently offer members the ability to receive streaming content through a host of internet-connected screens, including TVs, digital video players, television set-top boxes and mobile devices. We have agreements with various cable, satellite and telecommunications operators to make our service available through the television set-top boxes of these service providers. In many instances, our agreements also include provisions by which the partner bills consumers directly for the Netflix service or otherwise offers services or products in connection with offering our service. We intend to continue to broaden our relationships with existing partners and to increase our capability to stream TV series and movies to other platforms and partners over time. If we are not successful in maintaining existing and creating new relationships, or if we encounter technological, content licensing, regulatory, business or other impediments to delivering our streaming content to our members via these devices, our ability to retain members and grow our business could be adversely impacted.\n\nOur agreements with our partners are typically between one and three years in duration and our business could be adversely affected if, upon expiration, a number of our partners do not continue to provide access to our service or are unwilling to do so on terms acceptable to us, which terms may include the degree of accessibility and prominence of our service. Furthermore, devices are manufactured and sold by entities other than Netflix and while these entities should be responsible for the devices’ performance, the connection between these devices and Netflix may nonetheless result in consumer dissatisfaction toward Netflix and such dissatisfaction could result in claims against us or otherwise adversely impact our business. In addition, technology changes to our streaming functionality may require that partners update their devices. If partners do not update or otherwise modify their devices, our service and our members' use and enjoyment could be negatively impacted.\n\nAny significant disruption in or unauthorized access to our computer systems or those of third parties that we utilize in our operations, including those relating to cybersecurity or arising from cyber-attacks, could result in a loss or degradation of service, unauthorized disclosure of data, including member and corporate information, or theft of intellectual property, including digital content assets, which could adversely impact our business.\n\nOur reputation and ability to attract, retain and serve our members is dependent upon the reliable performance and security of our computer systems and those of third parties that we utilize in our operations. These systems may be subject to damage or interruption from earthquakes, adverse weather conditions, other natural disasters, terrorist attacks, power loss, telecommunications failures, and cybersecurity risks. Interruptions in these systems, or with the internet in general, could make our service unavailable or degraded or otherwise hinder our ability to deliver streaming content or fulfill DVD selections. Service interruptions, errors in our software or the unavailability of computer systems used in our operations could diminish the overall attractiveness of our membership service to existing and potential members.\n\nOur computer systems and those of third parties we use in our operations are subject to cybersecurity threats, including cyber-attacks, both from state-sponsored and individual activity, such as computer viruses, denial of service attacks, physical or electronic break-ins and similar disruptions. These systems periodically experience directed attacks intended to lead to interruptions and delays in our service and operations as well as loss, misuse or theft of data, confidential information or intellectual property. Additionally, outside parties may attempt to fraudulently induce employees or users to disclose sensitive or confidential information in order to gain access to data. Any attempt by hackers to obtain our data (including member and corporate information) or intellectual property (including digital content assets), disrupt our service, or otherwise access our systems, or those of third parties we use, if successful, could harm our business, be expensive to remedy and damage our reputation. We have implemented certain systems and processes to thwart hackers and protect our data and systems, but techniques used to gain unauthorized access to data and software are constantly evolving, and we may be unable to anticipate or prevent unauthorized access. Because of our prominence, we (and/or third parties we use) may be a particularly attractive target for such attacks, and from time to time, we have experienced an unauthorized release of certain digital content assets. However, to date these unauthorized releases have not had a material impact on our service or systems. There is no assurance that hackers may not have a material impact on our service or systems in the future. Our insurance does not cover expenses related to such disruptions or unauthorized access. Efforts to prevent hackers from disrupting our service or otherwise accessing our systems are expensive to develop, implement and maintain. These efforts require ongoing monitoring and updating as technologies change and efforts to overcome security measures become more sophisticated, and may limit the functionality of or otherwise negatively impact our service offering and systems. Any significant disruption to our service or access to our systems could result in a loss of memberships and adversely affect our business and results of operation. Further, a penetration of our systems or a third-party’s systems or other misappropriation or misuse of personal information could subject us to business, regulatory, litigation and reputation risk, which could have a negative effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\n7", 'Table of Contents\n\nWe utilize our own communications and computer hardware systems located either in our facilities or in that of a third-party Web hosting provider. In addition, we utilize third-party “cloud” computing services in connection with our business operations. We also utilize our own and third-party content delivery networks to help us stream TV series and movies in high volume to Netflix members over the internet. Problems faced by us or our third-party Web hosting, “cloud” computing, or other network providers, including technological or business-related disruptions, as well as cybersecurity threats and regulatory interference, could adversely impact the experience of our members.\n\nWe rely upon Amazon Web Services to operate certain aspects of our service and any disruption of or interference with our use of the Amazon Web Services operation would impact our operations and our business would be adversely impacted.\n\nAmazon Web Services (“AWS”) provides a distributed computing infrastructure platform for business operations, or what is commonly referred to as a "cloud" computing service. We have architected our software and computer systems so as to utilize data processing, storage capabilities and other services provided by AWS. Currently, we run the vast majority of our computing on AWS. Given this, along with the fact that we cannot easily switch our AWS operations to another cloud provider, any disruption of or interference with our use of AWS would impact our operations and our business would be adversely impacted. While the retail side of Amazon competes with us, we do not believe that Amazon will use the AWS operation in such a manner as to gain competitive advantage against our service, although if it was to do so it could harm our business.\n\nIf the technology we use in operating our business fails, is unavailable, or does not operate to expectations, our business and results of operation could be adversely impacted.\n\nWe utilize a combination of proprietary and third-party technology to operate our business. This includes the technology that we have developed to recommend and merchandise content to our consumers as well as enable fast and efficient delivery of content to our members and their various consumer electronic devices. For example, we have built and deployed our own content-delivery network (“CDN”). To the extent Internet Service Providers (“ISPs”) do not interconnect with our CDN, or if we experience difficulties in its operation, our ability to efficiently and effectively deliver our streaming content to our members could be adversely impacted and our business and results of operation could be adversely affected. Likewise, if our recommendation and merchandising technology does not enable us to predict and recommend titles that our members will enjoy, our ability to attract and retain members may be adversely affected. We also utilize third-party technology to help market our service, process payments, and otherwise manage the daily operations of our business. If our technology or that of third-parties we utilize in our operations fails or otherwise operates improperly, including as a result of “bugs” in our development and deployment of software, our ability to operate our service, retain existing members and add new members may be impaired. Any harm to our members’ personal computers or other devices caused by software used in our operations could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\n\nIf government regulations relating to the internet or other areas of our business change, we may need to alter the manner in which we conduct our business, or incur greater operating expenses.\n\nThe adoption or modification of laws or regulations relating to the internet or other areas of our business could limit or otherwise adversely affect the manner in which we currently conduct our business. As our service and others like us gain traction in international markets, governments are increasingly looking to introduce new or extend legacy regulations to these services, in particular those related to broadcast media and tax. For example, recent changes to European law enables individual member states to impose levies and other financial obligations on media operators located outside their jurisdiction. In addition, the continued growth and development of the market for online commerce may lead to more stringent consumer protection laws, which may impose additional burdens on us. If we are required to comply with new regulations or legislation or new interpretations of existing regulations or legislation, this compliance could cause us to incur additional expenses or alter our business model.\n\nChanges in laws or regulations that adversely affect the growth, popularity or use of the internet, including laws impacting net neutrality, could decrease the demand for our service and increase our cost of doing business. Certain laws intended to prevent network operators from discriminating against the legal traffic that traverse their networks have been implemented in many countries, including across the European Union. In others, the laws may be nascent or non-existent. Furthermore, favorable laws may change, including for example, in the United States where net neutrality regulations were repealed. Given uncertainty around these rules, including changing interpretations, amendments or repeal, coupled with potentially significant political and economic power of local network operators, we could experience discriminatory or anti-competitive practices that could impede our growth, cause us to incur additional expense or otherwise negatively affect our business.\n\n8', 'Table of Contents\n\nChanges in how network operators handle and charge for access to data that travel across their networks could adversely impact our business.\n\nWe rely upon the ability of consumers to access our service through the internet. If network operators block, restrict or otherwise impair access to our service over their networks, our service and business could be negatively affected. To the extent that network operators implement usage based pricing, including meaningful bandwidth caps, or otherwise try to monetize access to their networks by data providers, we could incur greater operating expenses and our membership acquisition and retention could be negatively impacted. Furthermore, to the extent network operators create tiers of internet access service and either charge us for or prohibit us from being available through these tiers, our business could be negatively impacted.\n\nMost network operators that provide consumers with access to the internet also provide these consumers with multichannel video programming. As such, many network operators have an incentive to use their network infrastructure in a manner adverse to our continued growth and success. While we believe that consumer demand, regulatory oversight and competition will help check these incentives, to the extent that network operators are able to provide preferential treatment to their data as opposed to ours or otherwise implement discriminatory network management practices, our business could be negatively impacted. The extent to which these incentives limit operator behavior differs across markets.\n\nPrivacy concerns could limit our ability to collect and leverage our membership data and disclosure of membership data could adversely impact our business and reputation.\n\nIn the ordinary course of business and in particular in connection with content acquisition and merchandising our service to our members, we collect and utilize data supplied by our members. We currently face certain legal obligations regarding the manner in which we treat such information, including but not limited to Regulation (EU) 2016/679 (also known as the General Data Protection Regulation or “GDPR”). Other businesses have been criticized by privacy groups and governmental bodies for attempts to link personal identities and other information to data collected on the internet regarding users’ browsing and other habits. Increased regulation of data utilization practices, including self-regulation or findings under existing laws that limit our ability to collect, transfer and use data, could have an adverse effect on our business. In addition, if we were to disclose data about our members in a manner that was objectionable to them, our business reputation could be adversely affected, and we could face potential legal claims that could impact our operating results. Internationally, we may become subject to additional and/or more stringent legal obligations concerning our treatment of customer and other personal information, such as laws regarding data localization and/or restrictions on data export. Failure to comply with these obligations could subject us to liability, and to the extent that we need to alter our business model or practices to adapt to these obligations, we could incur additional expenses.\n\nOur reputation and relationships with members would be harmed if our membership data, particularly billing data, were to be accessed by unauthorized persons.\n\nWe maintain personal data regarding our members, including names and billing data. This data is maintained on our own systems as well as that of third parties we use in our operations. With respect to billing data, such as credit card numbers, we rely on encryption and authentication technology to secure such information. We take measures to protect against unauthorized intrusion into our members’ data. Despite these measures we, our payment processing services or other third-party services we use such as AWS, could experience an unauthorized intrusion into our members’ data. In the event of such a breach, current and potential members may become unwilling to provide the information to us necessary for them to remain or become members. We also may be required to notify regulators about any actual or perceived data breach (including the EU Lead Data Protection Authority) as well as the individuals who are affected by the incident within strict time periods. Additionally, we could face legal claims or regulatory fines or penalties for such a breach. The costs relating to any data breach could be material, and we currently do not carry insurance against the risk of a data breach. We also maintain employment and personal information concerning our employees, as well as personal information of others working on our productions. Should an unauthorized intrusion into our members’ or employees’ data occur, our business could be adversely affected and our larger reputation with respect to data protection could be negatively impacted.\n\nWe are subject to payment processing risk.\n\nOur members pay for our service using a variety of different payment methods, including credit and debit cards, gift cards, prepaid cards, direct debit, online wallets and direct carrier and partner billing. We rely on internal systems as well as those of third parties to process payment. Acceptance and processing of these payment methods are subject to certain rules and regulations and require payment of interchange and other fees. To the extent there are increases in payment processing fees, material changes in the payment ecosystem, such as large re-issuances of payment cards, delays in receiving payments from payment processors, changes to rules or regulations concerning payment processing, loss of payment partners and/or disruptions or failures in our payment processing systems or payment products, including products we use to update payment information, our revenue, operating expenses and results of operation could be adversely impacted. In certain instances, we\n\n9', "Table of Contents\n\nleverage third parties such as our cable and other partners to bill subscribers on our behalf. If these third parties become unwilling or unable to continue processing payments on our behalf, we would have to transition subscribers or otherwise find alternative methods of collecting payments, which could adversely impact member acquisition and retention. In addition, from time to time, we encounter fraudulent use of payment methods, which could impact our results of operations and if not adequately controlled and managed could create negative consumer perceptions of our service. If we are unable to maintain our chargeback rate at acceptable levels, card networks may impose fines and our card approval rate may be impacted. The termination of our ability to process payments on any major payment method would significantly impair our ability to operate our business.\n\nIf our trademarks and other proprietary rights are not adequately protected to prevent use or appropriation by our competitors, the value of our brand and other intangible assets may be diminished, and our business may be adversely affected.\n\nWe rely and expect to continue to rely on a combination of confidentiality and license agreements with our employees, consultants and third parties with whom we have relationships, as well as trademark, copyright, patent and trade secret protection laws, to protect our proprietary rights. We may also seek to enforce our proprietary rights through court proceedings or other legal actions. We have filed and we expect to file from time to time for trademark and patent applications. Nevertheless, these applications may not be approved, third parties may challenge any copyrights, patents or trademarks issued to or held by us, third parties may knowingly or unknowingly infringe our intellectual property rights, and we may not be able to prevent infringement or misappropriation without substantial expense to us. If the protection of our intellectual property rights is inadequate to prevent use or misappropriation by third parties, the value of our brand, content, and other intangible assets may be diminished, competitors may be able to more effectively mimic our service and methods of operations, the perception of our business and service to members and potential members may become confused in the marketplace, and our ability to attract members may be adversely affected.\n\nWe currently hold various domain names relating to our brand, including Netflix.com. Failure to protect our domain names could adversely affect our reputation and brand and make it more difficult for users to find our Web site and our service. We may be unable, without significant cost or at all, to prevent third parties from acquiring domain names that are similar to, infringe upon or otherwise decrease the value of our trademarks and other proprietary rights.\n\nIntellectual property claims against us could be costly and result in the loss of significant rights related to, among other things, our website, streaming technology, our recommendation and merchandising technology, title selection processes and marketing activities.\n\nTrademark, copyright, patent and other intellectual property rights are important to us and other companies. Our intellectual property rights extend to our technology, business processes and the content we produce and distribute through our our service. We use the intellectual property of third parties in creating some of our content, merchandising our products and marketing our service. From time to time, third parties allege that we have violated their intellectual property rights. If we are unable to obtain sufficient rights, successfully defend our use, or develop non-infringing technology or otherwise alter our business practices on a timely basis in response to claims against us for infringement, misappropriation, misuse or other violation of third-party intellectual property rights, our business and competitive position may be adversely affected. Many companies are devoting significant resources to developing patents that could potentially affect many aspects of our business. There are numerous patents that broadly claim means and methods of conducting business on the internet. We have not searched patents relative to our technology. Defending ourselves against intellectual property claims, whether they are with or without merit or are determined in our favor, results in costly litigation and diversion of technical and management personnel. It also may result in our inability to use our current website, streaming technology, our recommendation and merchandising technology or inability to market our service or merchandise our products. We may also have to remove content from our service, or remove consumer products or marketing materials from the marketplace. As a result of a dispute, we may have to develop non-infringing technology, enter into royalty or licensing agreements, adjust our content, merchandising or marketing activities or take other actions to resolve the claims. These actions, if required, may be costly or unavailable on terms acceptable to us.\n\nWe are engaged in legal proceedings that could cause us to incur unforeseen expenses and could occupy a significant amount of our management's time and attention.\n\nFrom time to time, we are subject to litigation or claims that could negatively affect our business operations and financial position. As we have grown, we have seen a rise in the number of litigation matters against us. These matters have included copyright and other claims related to our content, patent infringement claims, employment related litigation, as well as consumer and securities class actions, each of which are typically expensive to defend. Litigation disputes could cause us to incur unforeseen expenses, result in content unavailability, service disruptions, and otherwise occupy a significant amount of our management's time and attention, any of which could negatively affect our business operations and financial position. We\n\n10", 'Table of Contents\n\nalso from time to time receive inquiries and subpoenas and other types of information requests from government authorities and we may become subject to related claims and other actions related to our business activities. While the ultimate outcome of investigations, inquiries, information requests and related legal proceedings is difficult to predict, such matters can be expensive, time-consuming and distracting, and adverse resolutions or settlements of those matters may result in, among other things, modification of our business practices, reputational harm or costs and significant payments, any of which could negatively affect our business operations and financial position.\n\nWe may seek additional capital that may result in stockholder dilution or that may have rights senior to those of our common stockholders.\n\nFrom time to time, we may seek to obtain additional capital, either through equity, equity-linked or debt securities. Our cash flows provided by our operating activities have been negative in each of the last four years, primarily as a result of our decision to increase the amount of original streaming content available on our service. To the extent our cash flows from operations continue to be negative, we anticipate seeking additional capital. The decision to obtain additional capital will depend on, among other things, our business plans, operating performance and condition of the capital markets. If we raise additional funds through the issuance of equity, equity-linked or debt securities, those securities may have rights, preferences or privileges senior to the rights of our common stock, and our stockholders may experience dilution. Any large equity or equity-linked offering could also negatively impact our stock price.\n\nWe have a substantial amount of indebtedness and other obligations, including streaming content obligations, which could adversely affect our financial position.\n\nWe have a substantial amount of indebtedness and other obligations, including streaming content obligations. Moreover, we expect to incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future and to incur other obligations, including additional streaming content obligations. As of December\xa031, 2018, we had $10.4 billion aggregate principal amount of senior notes outstanding (“Notes”). In addition, we have entered into a revolving credit agreement that provides for a $500 million unsecured revolving credit facility. As of December\xa031, 2018, we have not borrowed any amount under this revolving credit facility. As of December\xa031, 2018, we had approximately $8.4 billion of total content liabilities as reflected on our consolidated balance sheet. Such amount does not include streaming content commitments that do not meet the criteria for liability recognition, the amounts of which are significant. For more information on our streaming content obligations, including those not on our consolidated balance sheet, see Note 5, Commitments and Contingencies in the accompanying notes to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8, "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Our substantial indebtedness and other obligations, including streaming content obligations, may:\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  |  |\n| • | make it difficult for us to satisfy our financial obligations, including making scheduled principal and interest payments on our Notes and our other obligations; |\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  |  |\n| • | limit our ability to borrow additional funds for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions or other general business purposes; |\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  |  |\n| • | increase our cost of borrowing; |\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  |  |\n| • | limit our ability to use our cash flow or obtain additional financing for future working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions or other general business purposes; |\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  |  |\n| • | require us to use a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to make debt service payments and pay our other obligations when due; |\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  |  |\n| • | limit our flexibility to plan for, or react to, changes in our business and industry; |\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  |  |\n| • | place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our less leveraged competitors; and |\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  |  |\n| • | increase our vulnerability to the impact of adverse economic and industry conditions, including changes in interest rates. |\n\nOur streaming obligations include large multi-year commitments. As a result, we may be unable to react to any downturn in the economy or reduction in our cash flows from operations by reducing our streaming content obligations in the near-term. This could result in our needing to access the capital markets at an unfavorable time, which may negatively impact our stock price.\n\nWe may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service our debt and other obligations.\n\nOur ability to make payments on our debt, including our Notes, and our other obligations will depend on our financial and operating performance, which is subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions and to certain financial, business\n\n11', 'Table of Contents\n\nand other factors beyond our control. In each of the last four years, our cash flows from operating activities have been negative. We may be unable to attain a level of cash flows from operating activities sufficient to permit us to pay the principal, premium, if any, and interest on our debt, including the Notes, and other obligations, including amounts due under our streaming content obligations.\n\nIf we are unable to service our debt and other obligations from cash flows, we may need to refinance or restructure all or a portion of such obligations prior to maturity. Our ability to refinance or restructure our debt and other obligations will depend upon the condition of the capital markets and our financial condition at such time. Any refinancing or restructuring could be at higher interest rates and may require us to comply with more onerous covenants, which could further restrict our business operations. If our cash flows are insufficient to service our debt and other obligations, we may not be able to refinance or restructure any of these obligations on commercially reasonable terms or at all and any refinancing or restructuring could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition.\n\nIf our cash flows are insufficient to fund our debt and other obligations and we are unable to refinance or restructure these obligations, we could face substantial liquidity problems and may be forced to reduce or delay investments and capital expenditures, or to sell material assets or operations to meet our debt and other obligations. We cannot assure you that we would be able to implement any of these alternative measures on satisfactory terms or at all or that the proceeds from such alternatives would be adequate to meet any debt or other obligations then due. If it becomes necessary to implement any of these alternative measures, our business, results of operations, or financial condition could be materially and adversely affected.\n\nWe may lose key employees or may be unable to hire qualified employees.\n\nWe rely on the continued service of our senior management, including our Chief Executive Officer and co-founder Reed Hastings, members of our executive team and other key employees and the hiring of new qualified employees. In our industry, there is substantial and continuous competition for highly-skilled business, product development, technical and other personnel. We may not be successful in recruiting new personnel and in retaining and motivating existing personnel, which may be disruptive to our operations.\n\nLabor disputes may have an adverse effect on the Company’s business.\n\nOur partners, suppliers, vendors and we employ the services of writers, directors, actors and other talent as well as trade employees and others who are subject to collective bargaining agreements in the motion picture industry, both in the U.S. and internationally. If expiring collective bargaining agreements can not be renewed then it is possible that the affected unions could take action in the form of strikes or work stoppages. Such actions, as well as higher costs in connection with these collective bargaining agreements or a significant labor dispute, could have an adverse effect on our business by causing delays in production or by reducing profit margins.\n\nRisks Related to Our Stock Ownership\n\nProvisions in our charter documents and under Delaware law could discourage a takeover that stockholders may consider favorable.\n\nOur charter documents may discourage, delay or prevent a merger or acquisition that a stockholder may consider favorable because they:\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  |  |\n| • | authorize our board of directors, without stockholder approval, to issue up to 10,000,000 shares of undesignated preferred stock; |\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  |  |\n| • | provide for a classified board of directors; |\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  |  |\n| • | prohibit our stockholders from acting by written consent; |\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  |  |\n| • | establish advance notice requirements for proposing matters to be approved by stockholders at stockholder meetings; and |\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  |  |\n| • | prohibit stockholders from calling a special meeting of stockholders. |\n\nAs a Delaware corporation, we are also subject to certain Delaware anti-takeover provisions. Under Delaware law, a corporation may not engage in a business combination with any holder of 15% or more of its capital stock unless the holder has held the stock for three years or, among other things, the board of directors has approved the transaction. Our board of directors could rely on Delaware law to prevent or delay an acquisition of us.\n\nIn addition, a merger or acquisition may trigger retention payments to certain executive employees under the terms of our Amended and Restated Executive Severance and Retention Incentive Plan, thereby increasing the cost of such a transaction.\n\n12', 'Table of Contents\n\nOur stock price is volatile.\n\nThe price at which our common stock has traded has fluctuated significantly. The price may continue to be volatile due to a number of factors including the following, some of which are beyond our control:\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  |  |\n| • | variations in our operating results, including our membership acquisition and retention, revenues, operating income, net income and free cash flow; |\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  |  |\n| • | variations between our actual operating results and the expectations of securities analysts, investors and the financial community; |\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  |  |\n| • | announcements of developments affecting our business, systems or expansion plans by us or others; |\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  |  |\n| • | competition, including the introduction of new competitors, their pricing strategies and services; |\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  |  |\n| • | market volatility in general; |\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  |  |\n| • | the level of demand for our stock, including the amount of short interest in our stock; and |\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  |  |\n| • | the operating results of our competitors. |\n\nAs a result of these and other factors, investors in our common stock may not be able to resell their shares at or above their original purchase price.\n\nFollowing certain periods of volatility in the market price of our securities, we became the subject of securities litigation. We may experience more such litigation following future periods of volatility. This type of litigation may result in substantial costs and a diversion of management’s attention and resources.\n\nPreparing and forecasting our financial results requires us to make judgments and estimates which may differ materially from actual results.\n\nGiven the dynamic nature of our business, and the inherent limitations in predicting the future, forecasts of our revenues, operating margins, net income and number of paid membership additions and other financial and operating data may differ materially from actual results. Such discrepancies could cause a decline in the trading price of our common stock. In addition, the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America also requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported periods. We base such estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, but actual results may differ from these estimates. For example, we estimate the amortization pattern, beginning with the month of first availability, of any particular licensed or produced television series or movie based upon factors including historical and estimated viewing patterns. If we revise such estimates it could result in greater in-period expenses, which could cause us to miss our earnings guidance or negatively impact the results we report which could negatively impact our stock price.\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  |  |\n| Item 1B. | Unresolved Staff Comments |\n\nNone.\n\n13', 'Table of Contents\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  |  |\n| Item 2. | Properties |\n\nOur corporate headquarters are located in Los Gatos, California and consist of leased space aggregating approximately 600,000 square feet.

International revenues accounted for 50% of total streaming revenue for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to 45% of total streaming revenues for the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase in consolidated revenues was primarily driven by the growth in the average number of streaming paid memberships globally, the majority of which was growth in our international memberships. Average paid international streaming memberships accounted for 55% of total average streaming paid memberships as of December\xa031, 2018, as compared to 49% of total average streaming paid memberships as of December\xa031, 2017. In addition, average monthly revenue per paying streaming membership increased primarily due to price changes and a shift in the plan mix towards higher priced plans. The growth in paid net membership additions has been less volatile when compared to growth in total net membership additions as a result of free trial variability. We therefore believe paid memberships is a more reliable indicator of revenue growth.\n\nThe increase in operating margin is due primarily to increased revenues, partially offset by increased content expenses as we continue to acquire, license and produce content, including more Netflix originals, as well as increased marketing expenses and headcount costs to support continued improvements in our streaming service, our international expansion, and our growing content production activities.\n\nWe offer three main types of streaming membership plans. Our "basic" plan includes access to standard definition quality streaming on a single screen at a time. Our "standard" plan is our most popular streaming plan and includes access to high definition quality streaming on two screens concurrently. Our "premium" plan includes access to high definition and ultra-high definition quality content on four screens concurrently. As of December\xa031, 2018, pricing on our plans ranged in the U.S. from $7.99 to $13.99 per month and internationally from the U.S. dollar equivalent of approximately $3 to $20 per month. We expect that from time to time the prices of our membership plans in each country may increase and we may occasionally test other plan and price variations.\n\nThe following represents the key elements to our segment results of operations:\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  |  |\n| • | We define contribution profit (loss) as revenues less cost of revenues and marketing expenses incurred by the segment. This represents each segment\'s performance before global corporate costs. As markets within our International streaming segment become profitable, we increasingly focus on our global operating profit margin target as a measure of profitability. |\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  |  |\n| • | For the Domestic and International streaming segments, amortization of the streaming content assets makes up the majority of cost of revenues. Increasingly, we obtain multi-territory or global rights for our streaming content and allocate these rights between Domestic and International streaming segments based on estimated fair market value. |\n\n19', 'Table of Contents\n\nExpenses associated with the acquisition, licensing and production of streaming content (such as payroll and related personnel expenses, costs associated with obtaining rights to music included in our content, overall deals with talent, miscellaneous production related costs and participations and residuals), streaming delivery costs and other operations costs, make up the remainder of cost of revenues. We have built our own global content delivery network ("Open Connect") to help us efficiently stream a high volume of content to our members over the internet. Streaming delivery expenses, therefore, include equipment costs related to Open Connect, payroll and related personnel expenses and all third-party costs, such as cloud computing costs, associated with delivering streaming content over the internet. Other operations costs include customer service and payment processing fees, including those we pay to our integrated payment partners, as well as other costs incurred in making our content available to members.\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  |  |\n| • | For the Domestic and International streaming segments, marketing expenses consist primarily of advertising expenses and certain payments made to our marketing partners, including consumer electronics manufacturers, MVPDs, mobile operators and ISPs.

In 2018, the difference between our 1% effective tax rate and the Federal statutory rate of 21% was primarily due to the recognition of excess tax benefits of stock-based compensation, Federal and California research and development credits (“R&D”), and updated adjustments related to U.S. tax reform as a result of the U.S. federal tax return filing, partially offset by state taxes, foreign taxes, non-deductible expenses and the international provisions from the U.S. tax reform enacted in December 2017.\n\nOn December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the “Act”) was signed into law making significant changes to the Internal Revenue Code. Changes include, but are not limited to, a corporate tax rate decrease from 35% to 21% effective for tax years beginning after December 31, 2017, the transition of U.S. international taxation from a worldwide tax system to a territorial system, and a one-time transition tax on the mandatory deemed repatriation of cumulative foreign earnings as of December 31, 2017. In accordance with the Act, we recorded $79 million as additional income tax expense in the fourth quarter of 2017, the period in which the legislation was enacted. The total expense included $32 million related to the transition tax and $47 million related to the remeasurement of certain deferred tax assets and liabilities. Additionally, Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 ("SAB 118") was issued to address the application of U.S. GAAP in situations when a registrant does not have the necessary information available, prepared, or analyzed (including computations) in reasonable detail to complete the accounting for certain income tax effects of the Act. December 22, 2018 marked the end of the measurement period for purposes of SAB 118. As such, we have completed our analysis based on legislative updates relating to the Act currently available which resulted in an additional SAB 118 tax benefit of $34 million in the fourth quarter of 2018 and a total tax benefit of $72 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The total tax provision benefit included $45 million related to adjustments to the transition tax and a $27 million benefit related to the remeasurement of certain deferred tax assets and liabilities.\n\n24', 'Table of Contents\n\nYear ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2016\n\nAt the beginning of 2017, we underwent a corporate restructuring that better aligns our corporate structure with how our business operates. As a result of this restructuring and our increasing international income, there is now significantly more income being taxed at rates lower than the U.S. tax rate.\n\nThe decrease in our effective tax rate is mainly due to the recognition of excess tax benefits attributable to the adoption of ASU 2016-09 and an increase in foreign income taxed at rates lower than the U.S. statutory rate. In 2017, the difference between our (15)% effective tax rate and the Federal statutory rate of 35% was $(244) million primarily due to the recognition of excess tax benefits as a component of the provision for income taxes, an increase in foreign income taxed at rates lower than the U.S. statutory rate and Federal and California research and development credits (“R&D”), partially offset by state taxes and non-deductible expenses as well as the provisional impact of changes to tax law.\n\nOn December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the “Act”) was signed into law making significant changes to the Internal Revenue Code.

We have calculated our best estimate of the impact of the Act in our year end income tax provision in accordance with our understanding of the Act and guidance available as of the date of this filing and as a result have recorded $79 million as additional income tax expense in the fourth quarter of 2017, the period in which the legislation was enacted. The provisional amount related to the remeasurement of certain deferred tax assets and liabilities, based on the rates at which they are expected to reverse in the future, was $47 million. The provisional amount related to the one-time transition tax on the mandatory deemed repatriation of foreign earnings was $32 million based on cumulative foreign earnings of $485 million. We also recorded a $67 million benefit related to foreign taxes expensed in prior years that may now be claimed as a Foreign Tax Credit. We have determined there is sufficient foreign source income projected to utilize these credits.\n\n25', 'Table of Contents\n\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | | | | | | | |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|  | Year Ended December\xa031, | | | | | | |\n|  | 2018 | | |  | 2017 | | |\n|  | (in thousands) | | | | | | |\n| Cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash | $ | 3,812,041 |  |  | $ | 2,822,795 |  |\n| Long-term debt | 10,360,058 | |  |  | 6,499,432 | |  |\n\nCash, cash equivalents and restricted cash increased $989 million in the year ended December\xa031, 2018 primarily due to the issuance of debt, partially offset by cash used in operations.\n\nLong-term debt, net of debt issuance costs, increased $3,861 million due to long-term note issuances of $1,900 million in April 2018 and $800 million and €1,100 million in October 2018. The earliest maturity date for our outstanding long-term debt is February 2021. As of\xa0December\xa031, 2018, no amounts had been borrowed under our $500 million revolving credit facility. See Note 4 Long-term Debt in the accompanying notes to our consolidated financial statements. We anticipate continuing to finance our future capital needs in the debt market, as we continue to believe that our after-tax cost of debt is lower than our cost of equity. Our ability to obtain this or any additional financing that we may choose to, or need to, obtain will depend on, among other things, our development efforts, business plans, operating performance and the condition of the capital markets at the time we seek financing. We may not be able to obtain such financing on terms acceptable to us or at all. If we raise additional funds through the issuance of equity or debt securities, those securities may have rights, preferences or privileges senior to the rights of our common stock, and our stockholders may experience dilution.\n\nOur primary uses of cash include the acquisition, licensing and production of content, streaming delivery, marketing programs and personnel-related costs. Cash payment terms for non-original content have historically been in line with the amortization period. Investments in original content, and in particular content that we produce and own, require more cash upfront relative to licensed content. For example, production costs are paid as the content is created, well in advance of when the content is available on the service and amortized. We expect to continue to significantly increase our investments in global streaming content, particularly in original content, which will impact our liquidity and result in future negative free cash flows for many years. We currently anticipate that cash flows from operations, available funds and access to financing sources, including our revolving credit facility, will continue to be sufficient to meet our cash needs for at least the next twelve months.\n\nFree Cash Flow\n\nWe define free cash flow as cash provided by (used in) operating and investing activities excluding the non-operational cash flows from purchases, maturities and sales of short-term investments. We believe free cash flow is an important liquidity metric because it measures, during a given period, the amount of cash generated that is available to repay debt obligations, make investments and for certain other activities or the amount of cash used in operations, including investments in global streaming content. Free cash flow is considered a non-GAAP financial measure and should not be considered in isolation of, or as a substitute for, net income, operating income, cash flow used in operating activities, or any other measure of financial performance or liquidity presented in accordance with GAAP.\n\nIn assessing liquidity in relation to our results of operations, we compare free cash flow to net income, noting that the three major recurring differences are excess content payments over amortization, non-cash stock-based compensation expense and other working capital differences. Working capital differences include deferred revenue, taxes and semi-annual interest payments on our outstanding debt. Our receivables from members generally settle quickly and deferred revenue is a source of cash flow.\n\n26', 'Table of Contents\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | | | | | | | | | | | |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|  | Year Ended December\xa031, | | | | | | | | | | |\n|  | 2018 | | |  | 2017 | | |  | 2016 | | |\n|  | (in thousands) | | | | | | | | | | |\n| Net cash used in operating activities | $ | (2,680,479 | ) |  | $ | (1,785,948 | ) |  | $ | (1,473,984 | ) |\n| Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities | (339,120 | | ) |  | 34,329 | |  |  | 49,765 | |  |\n| Net cash provided by financing activities | 4,048,527 | |  |  | 3,076,990 | |  |  | 1,091,630 | |  |\n|  |  | | |  |  | | |  |  | | |\n| Non-GAAP free cash flow reconciliation: |  | | |  |  | | |  |  | | |\n| Net cash used in operating activities | (2,680,479 | | ) |  | (1,785,948 | | ) |  | (1,473,984 | | ) |\n| Acquisition of DVD content assets | (38,586 | | ) |  | (53,720 | | ) |  | (77,177 | | ) |\n| Purchases of property and equipment | (173,946 | | ) |  | (173,302 | | ) |  | (107,653 | | ) |\n| Other assets | (126,588 | | ) |  | (6,689 | | ) |  | (941 | | ) |\n| Non-GAAP free cash flow | $ | (3,019,599 | ) |  | $ | (2,019,659 | ) |  | $ | (1,659,755 | ) |\n\nYear ended December 31, 2018 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2017\n\nNet cash used in operating activities increased $895 million to $2,680 million for the year ended December\xa031, 2018. The increased use of cash was primarily driven by the increase in investments in streaming content that require more upfront payments, partially offset by a $4,102 million or 35% increase in revenues. The payments for streaming content assets increased $3,138 million, from $8,906 million to $12,044 million, or 35%, as compared to the increase in the amortization of streaming content assets of $1,334 million, from $6,198 million to $7,532 million, or 22%. In addition, we had increased payments associated with higher operating expenses, primarily related to increased headcount to support our continued improvements in our streaming service, our international expansion and increased content production activities.\n\nNet cash used in investing activities increased $373 million, primarily due to the decrease in proceeds from the sale of short-term investments, net of purchases, of $268 million. In July 2017, the Company sold all short-term investments. In addition, the cash used to purchase other assets increased $120 million primarily driven by the acquisition of intangible assets in the year ended December\xa031, 2018.\n\nNet cash provided by financing activities increased $972 million due to an increase in the proceeds from the issuance of debt of $938 million from $2,988 million in the year ended December\xa031, 2017 to $3,926 million in the year ended December\xa031, 2018. In addition, we had an increase in the proceeds from the issuance of common stock of $36 million.\n\nNon-GAAP free cash flow was $4,231 million lower than net income for the year ended December\xa031, 2018 primarily due to $4,512 million of cash payments for streaming content assets over streaming amortization expense and $40 million in other non-favorable working capital differences, partially offset by $321 million of non-cash stock-based compensation expense.\n\nYear ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2016\n\nNet cash used in operating activities increased $312 million to $1,786 million for the year ended December\xa031, 2017. The increased use of cash was primarily driven by the increase in investments in streaming content that require more upfront payments, partially offset by a $2,862 million or 32% increase in revenues. The payments for streaming content assets increased $2,025 million, from $6,881 million to $8,906 million, or 29%, as compared to an increase in the amortization of streaming content assets of $1,409 million, from $4,788 million to $6,198 million, or 29%. In addition, we had increased payments associated with higher operating expenses, primarily related to increased headcount costs to support our continued improvements in our streaming service, our international expansion and increased content production activities. The increased use of cash was partially offset by a $2,862 million or 32% increase in revenues.\n\nNet cash provided by investing activities decreased $15 million, primarily due to a $66 million increase in the purchases of property and equipment, largely due to the expansion of our Los Gatos, California headquarters, as well as our new office space in Los Angeles, California. This increase in cash used was partially offset by an increase of $33 million in the proceeds from sales and maturities of short-term investments, net of purchases due to the sale of our short-term investments in July 2017 as well as a decline in DVD purchases of $24 million.\n\nNet cash provided by financing activities increased $1,985 million due to an increase in the proceeds from the issuance of debt of $1,999 million from $989 million in the year ended December\xa031, 2016 to $2,988 million in the year ended December\xa031, 2017.\n\n27', 'Table of Contents\n\nNon-GAAP free cash flow was $2,579 million lower than net income for the year ended\xa0December\xa031, 2017\xa0primarily due to $2,708 million of cash payments for streaming content assets over streaming amortization expense and $53 million of unfavorable other working capital differences, partially offset by $182 million of non-cash stock-based compensation expense.\n\nContractual Obligations\n\nFor the purpose of this table, contractual obligations for purchases of goods or services are defined as agreements that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction.

An obligation for the production of content includes non-cancelable commitments under creative talent and employment agreements and other production related commitments. An obligation for the acquisition and licensing of content is incurred at the time we enter into an agreement to obtain future titles. Once a title becomes available, a content liability is recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Certain agreements include the obligation to license rights for unknown future titles, the ultimate quantity and/or fees for which are not yet determinable as of the reporting date. Traditional film output deals, or certain TV series license agreements where the number of seasons to be aired is unknown, are examples of these types of agreements. The contractual obligations table above does not include any estimated obligation for the unknown future titles, payment for which could range from less than one year to more than five years. However, these unknown obligations are expected to be significant and we believe could include approximately $2 billion to $5 billion over the next three years, with the payments for the vast majority of such amounts expected to occur after the next twelve months. The foregoing range is based on considerable management judgments and the actual amounts may differ. Once we know the title that we will receive and the license fees, we include the amount in the contractual obligations table above.\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  |  |\n| (2) | Long-term debt obligations include our Notes consisting of principal and interest payments.

These contracts are primarily related to streaming delivery and cloud computing costs, as well as other miscellaneous open purchase orders for which we have not received the related services or goods. |\n\nAs of December\xa031, 2018, we had gross unrecognized tax benefits of $48 million which was classified in “Other non-current liabilities” and a reduction to deferred tax assets which was classified as "Other non-current assets" in the consolidated balance sheets. At this time, an estimate of the range of reasonably possible adjustments to the balance of unrecognized tax benefits cannot be made.\n\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\n\nWe do not have transactions with unconsolidated entities, such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities, whereby we have financial guarantees, subordinated retained interests, derivative instruments, or other contingent arrangements that expose us to material continuing risks, contingent liabilities, or any other obligation under a variable interest in an unconsolidated entity that provides financing, liquidity, market risk, or credit risk support to us.\n\nIndemnifications\n\nThe information set forth under Note 6 Guarantees - Indemnification Obligations in the accompanying notes to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8, "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K is incorporated herein by reference.\n\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\n\nThe preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported periods. The Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") has defined a company’s critical accounting policies as the ones that are most important to the portrayal of a company’s financial condition and results of operations, and which require a company to make its most difficult and subjective judgments. Based on this definition, we have identified the critical accounting policies and judgments addressed below. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates.\n\nStreaming Content\n\nWe acquire, license and produce content, including original programing, in order to offer our members unlimited viewing of TV series and films. The content licenses are for a fixed fee and specific windows of availability. Payment terms for certain content licenses and the production of content require more upfront cash payments relative to the amortization expense. Payments for content, including additions to streaming assets and the changes in related liabilities, are classified within "Net cash used in operating activities" on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.\n\nFor licenses, we capitalize the fee per title and record a corresponding liability at the gross amount of the liability when the license period begins, the cost of the title is known and the title is accepted and available for streaming. The portion available for streaming within one year is recognized as “Current content assets, net” and the remaining portion as “Non-current content assets, net” on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\n\nFor productions, we capitalize costs associated with the production, including development cost, direct costs and production overhead. We include these amounts in "Non-current content assets, net" on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Participations and residuals are expensed in line with the amortization of production costs.\n\nBased on factors including historical and estimated viewing patterns, we amortize the content assets (licensed and produced) in “Cost of revenues” on the Consolidated Statements of Operations over the shorter of each title\'s contractual window of availability or estimated period of use or ten years, beginning with the month of first availability. The amortization is on an accelerated basis, as we typically expect more upfront viewing, for instance due to additional merchandising and marketing efforts, and film amortization is more accelerated than TV series amortization. We review factors that impact the amortization of the content assets on an ongoing basis. Our estimates related to these factors require considerable management judgment.\n\n29', 'Table of Contents\n\nOur business model is subscription based as opposed to a model generating revenues at a specific title level. Therefore, content assets, both licensed and produced, are reviewed in aggregate at the operating segment level when an event or change in circumstances indicates a change in the expected usefulness of the content asset. To date, we have not identified any such event or changes in circumstances. If such changes are identified in the future, these aggregated content assets will be stated at the lower of unamortized cost, net realizable value or fair value. In addition, unamortized costs for assets that have been, or are expected to be, abandoned are written off.\n\nIncome Taxes\n\nWe record a provision for income taxes for the anticipated tax consequences of our reported results of operations using the asset and liability method. Deferred income taxes are recognized by applying enacted statutory tax rates applicable to future years to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases as well as net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. The measurement of deferred tax assets is reduced, if necessary, by a valuation allowance for any tax benefits for which future realization is uncertain.\n\nAlthough we believe our assumptions, judgments and estimates are reasonable, changes in tax laws or our interpretation of tax laws and the resolution of any tax audits could significantly impact the amounts provided for income taxes in our consolidated financial statements.\n\nIn evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets, in full or in part, we consider all available positive and negative evidence, including our past operating results, and our forecast of future earnings, future taxable income and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies. The assumptions utilized in determining future taxable income require significant judgment and are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying businesses. Actual operating results in future years could differ from our current assumptions, judgments and estimates. However, we believe that it is more likely than not that most of the deferred tax assets recorded on our Consolidated Balance Sheets will ultimately be realized. We record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the net amount that we believe is more likely than not to be realized. At December 31, 2018 the valuation allowance of $125 million was primarily related to foreign tax credits that we are not expected to realize.\n\nWe did not recognize certain tax benefits from uncertain tax positions within the provision for income taxes. We may recognize a tax benefit only if it is more likely than not the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such positions are then measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon settlement. At December\xa031, 2018, our estimated gross unrecognized tax benefits were $48 million of which $44 million, if recognized, would favorably impact our future earnings. Due to uncertainties in any tax audit outcome, our estimates of the ultimate settlement of our unrecognized tax positions may change and the actual tax benefits may differ significantly from the estimates.\n\nOn December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the “Act”) was signed into law making significant changes to the Internal Revenue Code. Changes include, but are not limited to, a corporate tax rate decrease from 35% to 21% effective for tax years beginning after December 31, 2017, the transition of U.S international taxation from a worldwide tax system to a territorial system, and a one-time transition tax on the mandatory deemed repatriation of cumulative foreign earnings as of December 31, 2017. In accordance with the Act, we recorded $79 million as additional income tax expense in the fourth quarter of 2017, the period in which the legislation was enacted. The total expense included $32 million related to the transition tax and $47 million related to the remeasurement of certain deferred tax assets and liabilities. Additionally, Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 ("SAB 118") was issued to address the application of U.S. GAAP in situations when a registrant does not have the necessary information available, prepared, or analyzed (including computations) in reasonable detail to complete the accounting for certain income tax effects of the Act. December 22, 2018 marked the end of the measurement period for purposes of SAB 118. As such, we have completed our analysis based on legislative updates relating to the Act currently available which resulted in an additional SAB 118 tax benefit of $34 million in the fourth quarter of 2018 and a total tax benefit of $72 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The total tax provision benefit included $45 million related to adjustments to the transition tax and a $27 million benefit related to the remeasurement of certain deferred tax assets and liabilities.\n\nSee Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements for further information regarding income taxes.\n\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\n\nThe information set forth under Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements under the caption “Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” is incorporated herein by reference.\n\n30', 'Table of Contents\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  |  |\n| Item 7A. | Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk |\n\nWe are exposed to market risks related to interest rate changes and the corresponding changes in the market values of our debt and foreign currency fluctuations. In July 2017, we sold all short-term investments.\n\nInterest Rate Risk\n\nAt December\xa031, 2018, our cash equivalents were generally invested in money market funds, which are not subject to market risk because the interest paid on such funds fluctuates with the prevailing interest rate.\n\nAs of December\xa031, 2018, we had $10.4 billion of debt, consisting of fixed rate unsecured debt in ten tranches due between 2021 and 2029. Refer to Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements for details about all issuances. The fair value of our debt will fluctuate with movements of interest rates, increasing in periods of declining rates of interest and declining in periods of increasing rates of interest. The fair value of our debt will also fluctuate based on changes in foreign currency rates, as discussed below.\n\nForeign Currency Risk\n\nInternational revenues and cost of revenues account for 49% and 58%, respectively, of consolidated amounts for the year ended December\xa031, 2018. The majority of international revenues and a smaller portion of expenses are denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar and we therefore have foreign currency risk related to these currencies, which are primarily the euro, the British pound, the Canadian dollar, the Australian dollar, the Japanese yen, the Mexican peso and the Brazilian real.\n\nAccordingly, changes in exchange rates, and in particular a weakening of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar may negatively affect our revenue and contribution profit (loss) of our International streaming segment as expressed in U.S. dollars. For the year ended December\xa031, 2018, we believe our international revenues would have been approximately $94 million higher had foreign currency exchange rates remained consistent with those for the year ended December\xa031, 2017.\n\nWe have also experienced and will continue to experience fluctuations in our net income as a result of gains (losses) on the settlement and the remeasurement of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies that are not the functional currency. In the year ended December\xa031, 2018, we recognized a $1 million foreign exchange loss due to the remeasurement of significant content liabilities denominated in currencies other than functional currencies of our European and U.S. entities, mostly offset by the remeasurement of our Senior Notes denominated in euros.\n\nIn addition, the effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents in the year ended December\xa031, 2018 was a decrease of $40 million.\n\nWe do not use foreign exchange contracts or derivatives to hedge any foreign currency exposures. The volatility of exchange rates depends on many factors that we cannot forecast with reliable accuracy. Our continued international expansion increases our exposure to exchange rate fluctuations and as a result such fluctuations could have a significant impact on our future results of operations.\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  |  |\n| Item 8. | Financial Statements and Supplementary Data |\n\nThe consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes listed in Part IV, Item\xa015(a)(1) of this Annual Report on Form 10-K are included immediately following Part IV hereof and incorporated by reference herein.\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  |  |\n| Item 9. | Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure |\n\nNone.\n\n31', 'Table of Contents\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  |  |\n| Item 9A. | Controls and Procedures |\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  |  |\n| (a) | Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures |\n\nOur management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K were effective in providing reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission’s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures.\n\nOur management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal controls will prevent all error and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within Netflix have been detected.\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  |  |\n| (b) | Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting |\n\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as amended (the Exchange Act)). Our management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December\xa031, 2018. In making this assessment, our management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (“COSO”) in Internal Control—Integrated Framework (2013 framework). Based on our assessment under the framework in Internal Control—Integrated Framework (2013 framework), our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December\xa031, 2018. The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December\xa031, 2018 has been audited by Ernst & Young LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report that is included herein.\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  |  |\n| (c) | Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting |\n\nThere was no change in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended December\xa031, 2018 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\n\n32', 'Table of Contents\n\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\n\nTo the stockholders and the Board of Directors of Netflix, Inc.\n\nOpinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\n\nWe have audited Netflix, Inc.’s internal control over financial reporting as of December\xa031, 2018, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). In our opinion, Netflix, Inc. (the Company) maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December\xa031, 2018, based on the COSO criteria.\n\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of December\xa031, 2018 and 2017, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, stockholders’ equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December\xa031, 2018 and the related notes and our report dated January\xa029, 2019 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.\n\nBasis for Opinion\n\nThe Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\n\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.\n\nOur audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\n\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\n\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\n\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  | |\n|  |  |\n|  | /s/ Ernst & Young LLP |\n| San Jose, California |  |\n| January\xa029, 2019 |  |\n\n33', 'Table of Contents\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  |  |\n| Item 9B. | Other Information |\n\nNone.\n\n34', 'Table of Contents\n\nPART III\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  |  |\n| Item 10. | Directors, Executive Officers and Corporate Governance |\n\nInformation regarding our directors and executive officers is incorporated by reference from the information contained under the sections “Proposal One: Election of Directors,” “Section 16(a) Beneficial Ownership Compliance” and “Code of Ethics” in our Proxy Statement for the Annual Meeting of Stockholders.\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  |  |\n| Item 11. | Executive Compensation |\n\nInformation required by this item is incorporated by reference from information contained under the section “Compensation of Executive Officers and Other Matters” in our Proxy Statement for the Annual Meeting of Stockholders.\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  |  |\n| Item 12. | Security Ownership of Certain Beneficial Owners and Management and Related Stockholder Matters |\n\nInformation required by this item is incorporated by reference from information contained under the sections “Security Ownership of Certain Beneficial Owners and Management” and “Equity Compensation Plan Information” in our Proxy Statement for the Annual Meeting of Stockholders.\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  |  |\n| Item 13. | Certain Relationships and Related Transactions, and Director Independence |\n\nInformation required by this item is incorporated by reference from information contained under the section “Certain Relationships and Related Transactions” and “Director Independence” in our Proxy Statement for the Annual Meeting of Stockholders.\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  |  |\n| Item 14. | Principal Accounting Fees and Services |\n\nInformation with respect to principal independent registered public accounting firm fees and services is incorporated by reference from the information under the caption “Proposal Two: Ratification of Appointment of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm” in our Proxy Statement for the Annual Meeting of Stockholders.\n\n35', 'Table of Contents\n\nPART IV\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  |  |\n| Item 15. | Exhibits, Financial Statement Schedules |\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  |  |\n| (a) | The following documents are filed as part of this Annual Report on Form 10-K: |\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  |  |\n| (1) | Financial Statements: |\n\nThe financial statements are filed as part of this Annual Report on Form 10-K under “Item 8.

Policies |\n\nDescription of Business\n\nNetflix, Inc. (the “Company”) was incorporated on August\xa029, 1997 and began operations on April\xa014, 1998. The Company is the world’s leading internet entertainment service with over 139 million paid memberships in over 190 countries enjoying TV series, documentaries and feature films across a wide variety of genres and languages. Members can watch as much as they want, anytime, anywhere, on any internet-connected screen. Members can play, pause and resume watching, all without commercials or commitments. Additionally, over two million members in the U.S. subscribe to the Company\'s legacy DVD-by-mail service.\n\nBasis of Presentation\n\nThe consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. Intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated.\n\nReclassification\n\nCertain prior period amounts in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Segment Information presented in Note 11 have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation. Specifically, certain expenses for personnel that support global content and marketing that were previously classified in General and administrative expenses were reclassified to Cost of revenues and Marketing, respectively. In addition, expenses for personnel that support global streaming delivery that were previously classified in Technology and development were also reclassified to Cost of revenues. There is no change to consolidated operating income, net income or cash flows or DVD segment results as a result of this change in classification. See Note 12 for further detail.\n\nUse of Estimates\n\nThe preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Significant items subject to such estimates and assumptions include the streaming content asset amortization policy and the recognition and measurement of income tax assets and liabilities. The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that the Company believes to be reasonable under the circumstances. On an ongoing basis, the Company evaluates these assumptions, judgments and estimates. Actual results may differ from these estimates.\n\nRecently adopted accounting pronouncements\n\nIn May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) which amended the existing accounting standards for revenue recognition. ASU 2014-09 establishes principles for recognizing revenue upon the transfer of promised goods or services to customers, in an amount that reflects the expected consideration received in exchange for those goods or services. The Company adopted ASU 2014-09 in the first quarter of 2018 using the modified retrospective approach. Because the Company\'s primary source of revenues is from monthly membership fees which are recognized ratably over each monthly membership period, the impact on its consolidated financial statements is not material.\n\nIn November 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-18, Restricted Cash, which requires amounts generally described as restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents be included with cash and cash equivalents when reconciling the total beginning and ending amounts for the periods shown on the statement of cash flows. The Company adopted ASU 2016-18 in the first quarter of 2018 and the impact on its consolidated financial statements is not material as the Company\'s restricted cash balances are immaterial.\n\nIn January 2018, the FASB released guidance on the accounting for tax on the global intangible low-taxed income (“GILTI”) provisions of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Act”). The GILTI provisions impose a tax on foreign income in excess of a deemed return on tangible assets of foreign corporations. In the first quarter of 2018, the Company elected to treat any potential GILTI inclusions as a period cost.\n\nIn August 2018, the SEC adopted the final rule under SEC Release No. 33-10532, Disclosure Update and\xa0Simplification, amending certain disclosure requirements that were redundant, duplicative, overlapping, outdated or superseded. In addition,\n\n45', 'Table of Contents\n\nthe amendments expanded the disclosure requirements on the analysis of stockholders\' equity for interim financial statements. Under the amendments, an analysis of changes in each caption of stockholders\' equity presented in the balance sheet must be provided in a note or separate statement. The analysis should present a reconciliation of the beginning balance to the ending balance of each period for which a statement of comprehensive income is required to be filed. This final rule was effective on November 5, 2018. The Company adopted the rule in the fourth quarter of 2018 and the impact on its consolidated financial statements was not material.\n\nRecently issued accounting pronouncements not yet adopted\n\nIn February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842) in order to increase transparency and comparability among organizations by recognizing lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet for those leases classified as operating leases under current GAAP. ASU 2016-02 requires that a lessee should recognize a liability to make lease payments (the lease liability) and a right-of-use asset representing its right to use the underlying asset for the lease term on the balance sheet. ASU 2016-02 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018 (including interim periods within those periods) using a modified retrospective approach and early adoption is permitted. The Company will adopt ASU 2016-02 in the first quarter of 2019 utilizing the modified retrospective transition method through a cumulative-effect adjustment at the beginning of the first quarter of 2019. While the Company is continuing to assess the potential impacts of ASU 2016-02, the Company estimates that the adoption of ASU 2016-02 will result in the recognition of right-of-use assets and lease liabilities for operating leases of approximately $700 million on its Consolidated Balance Sheets, with no material impact to its Consolidated Statements of Operations.\n\nCash Equivalents and Short-term Investments\n\nThe Company considers investments in instruments purchased with an original maturity of 90 days or less to be cash equivalents. The Company also classifies amounts in transit from payment processors for customer credit card and debit card transactions as cash equivalents.\n\nIn July 2017, the Company sold all short-term investments. The Company classified short-term investments, which consisted of marketable securities with original maturities in excess of 90 days as available-for-sale. Short-term investments were reported at fair value with unrealized gains and losses included in “Accumulated other comprehensive loss” within Stockholders’ equity in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The amortization of premiums and discounts on the investments, realized gains and losses, and declines in value judged to be other-than-temporary on available-for-sale securities are included in “Interest and other income (expense)” in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The Company used the specific identification method to determine cost in calculating realized gains and losses upon the sale of short-term investments.\n\nShort-term investments were reviewed periodically to identify possible other-than-temporary impairment. When evaluating the investments, the Company reviewed factors such as the length of time and extent to which fair value has been below cost basis, the financial condition of the issuer, the Company’s intent to sell, or whether it would be more likely than not that the Company would be required to sell the investments before the recovery of their amortized cost basis.\n\nStreaming Content\n\nThe Company acquires, licenses and produces content, including original programming, in order to offer members unlimited viewing of TV series and films. The content licenses are for a fixed fee and specific windows of availability. Payment terms for certain content licenses and the production of content require more upfront cash payments relative to the amortization expense. Payments for content, including additions to streaming assets and the changes in related liabilities, are classified within "Net cash used in operating activities" on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.\n\nFor licenses, the Company capitalizes the fee per title and records a corresponding liability at the gross amount of the liability when the license period begins, the cost of the title is known and the title is accepted and available for streaming. The portion available for streaming within one year is recognized as “Current content assets, net” and the remaining portion as “Non-current content assets, net” on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\n\nFor productions, the Company capitalizes costs associated with the production, including development costs, direct costs and production overhead. These amounts are included in "Non-current content assets, net" on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Participations and residuals are expensed in line with the amortization of production costs.\n\nBased on factors including historical and estimated viewing patterns, the Company amortizes the content assets (licensed and produced) in “Cost of revenues” on the Consolidated Statements of Operations over the shorter of each title\'s contractual window of availability or estimated period of use or 10 years, beginning with the month of first availability. The amortization is on an accelerated basis, as the Company typically expects more upfront viewing, for instance due to additional merchandising and marketing efforts, and film amortization is more accelerated than TV series amortization. The Company\n\n46', "Table of Contents\n\nreviews factors impacting the amortization of the content assets on an ongoing basis. The Company's estimates related to these factors require considerable management judgment.\n\nThe Company's business model is subscription based as opposed to a model generating revenues at a specific title level. Therefore, content assets, both licensed and produced, are reviewed in aggregate at the operating segment level when an event or change in circumstances indicates a change in the expected usefulness of the content asset. To date, the Company has not identified any such event or changes in circumstances. If such changes are identified in the future, these aggregated content assets will be stated at the lower of unamortized cost, net realizable value or fair value. In addition, unamortized costs for assets that have been, or are expected to be, abandoned are written off.\n\nProperty and Equipment\n\nProperty and equipment are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method over the shorter of the estimated useful lives of the respective assets, generally up to 30 years, or the expected lease term for leasehold improvements, if applicable. Leased buildings are capitalized and included in property and equipment when the Company was involved in the construction funding and did not meet the “sale-leaseback” criteria.\n\nRevenue Recognition\n\nThe Company's primary source of revenues are from monthly membership fees. Members are billed in advance of the start of their monthly membership and revenues are recognized ratably over each monthly membership period. Revenues are presented net of the taxes that are collected from members and remitted to governmental authorities. Deferred revenue consists of membership fees billed that have not been recognized and gift and other prepaid memberships that have not been redeemed. The Company is the principal in all its relationships where partners, including consumer electronics (“CE”) manufacturers, multichannel video programming distributors (“MVPDs”), mobile operators and internet service providers (“ISPs”), provide access to the service as the Company retains control over service delivery to its members. Typically, payments made to the partners, such as for marketing, are expensed, but in the case where the price that the member pays is established by the partners and there is no standalone price for the Netflix service (for instance, in a bundle), these payments are recognized as a reduction of revenues.\n\nMarketing\n\nMarketing expenses consist primarily of advertising expenses and certain payments made to the Company’s partners, including CE manufacturers, MVPDs, mobile operators and ISPs. Advertising expenses include promotional activities such as digital and television advertising. Advertising costs are expensed as incurred. Advertising expenses were $1,808 million, $1,091 million and $842 million for the years ended December\xa031, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Marketing expenses also include payroll and related expenses for personnel that support the Company's marketing activities.\n\nResearch and Development\n\nResearch and development expenses consist of payroll and related costs incurred in making improvements to our service offerings. Research and development expenses were $1,218 million, $981 million and $768 million for the years ended December\xa031, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.\n\nIncome Taxes\n\nThe Company records a provision for income taxes for the anticipated tax consequences of the reported results of operations using the asset and liability method. Deferred income taxes are recognized by applying enacted statutory tax rates applicable to future years to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases as well as net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. The measurement of deferred tax assets is reduced, if necessary, by a valuation allowance for any tax benefits for which future realization is uncertain.\n\nThe Company did not recognize certain tax benefits from uncertain tax positions within the provision for income taxes. The Company may recognize a tax benefit only if it is more likely than not the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such positions are then measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon settlement. The Company recognizes interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions in income tax expense. See Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements for further information regarding income taxes.\n\n47", 'Table of Contents\n\nForeign Currency\n\nThe functional currency for the Company\'s subsidiaries is determined based on the primary economic environment in which the subsidiary operates. The Company translates the assets and liabilities of its non-U.S. dollar functional currency subsidiaries into U.S. dollars using exchange rates in effect at the end of each period. Revenues and expenses for these subsidiaries are translated using rates that approximate those in effect during the period. Gains and losses from these translations are recognized in cumulative translation adjustment included in "Accumulated other comprehensive loss" in Stockholders’ equity on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\n\nThe Company remeasures monetary assets and liabilities that are not denominated in the functional currency at exchange rates in effect at the end of each period. Gains and losses from these remeasurements are recognized in interest and other income (expense). Foreign currency transactions resulted in a loss of $1 million and $128 million for the years ended December\xa031, 2018 and 2017, respectively, and a gain of $23 million for the year ended December 31, 2016.\n\nEarnings Per Share\n\nBasic earnings per share is computed using the weighted-average number of outstanding shares of common stock during the period. Diluted earnings per share is computed using the weighted-average number of outstanding shares of common stock and, when dilutive, potential common shares outstanding during the period.

Revolving loans may be borrowed, repaid and reborrowed until July 27, 2022, at which time all amounts borrowed must be repaid. The Company may use the proceeds of future borrowings under the Revolving Credit Agreement for working capital and general corporate purposes. As of\xa0December\xa031, 2018, no amounts have been borrowed under the Revolving Credit Agreement.\n\nThe borrowings under the Revolving Credit Agreement bear interest, at the Company’s option, of either (i) a floating rate equal to a base rate (the “Alternate Base Rate”) or (ii) a rate equal to an adjusted London interbank offered rate (the “Adjusted LIBO Rate”), plus a margin of\xa00.75%. The Alternate Base Rate is defined as the greatest of (A) the rate of interest published by the Wall Street Journal, from time to time, as the prime rate, (B) the federal funds rate, plus\xa00.500%\xa0and (C) the Adjusted LIBO Rate for a one-month interest period, plus\xa01.00%. The Adjusted LIBO Rate is defined as the London interbank offered rate for deposits in U.S. dollars, for the relevant interest period, adjusted for statutory reserve requirements, but in no event shall the Adjusted LIBO Rate be less than\xa00.00%\xa0per annum.\n\nThe Company is also obligated to pay a commitment fee on the undrawn amounts of the Revolving Credit Agreement at a rate of\xa00.10%. The Revolving Credit Agreement requires the Company to comply with certain covenants, including covenants that limit or restrict the ability of the Company’s subsidiaries to incur debt and limit or restrict the ability of the Company and its subsidiaries to grant liens and enter into sale and leaseback transactions; and, in the case of the Company or a guarantor, merge, consolidate, liquidate, dissolve or sell, transfer, lease or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole.

Obligations that are in non-U.S. dollar currencies are translated to the U.S. dollar at period end rates. An obligation for the production of content includes non-cancelable commitments under creative talent and employment agreements as well as other production related commitments. An obligation for the acquisition and licensing of content is incurred at the time the Company enters into an agreement to obtain future titles. Once a title becomes available, a content liability is recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Certain agreements include the obligation to license rights for unknown future titles, the ultimate quantity and/or fees for which are not yet determinable as of the reporting date. Traditional film output deals, or certain TV series license agreements where the number of seasons to be aired is unknown, are examples of such license agreements. The Company does not include any estimated obligation for these future titles beyond the known minimum amount. However, the unknown obligations are expected to be significant.\n\nLease obligations\n\n53', "Table of Contents\n\nThe Company leases facilities under non-cancelable operating leases with various expiration dates through 2034. Several lease agreements contain rent escalation clauses or rent holidays. For purposes of recognizing minimum rental expenses on a straight-line basis over the terms of the leases, the Company uses the date of initial possession to begin amortization, which is generally when the Company enters the space and begins to make improvements in preparation for intended use. For scheduled rent escalation clauses during the lease terms or for rental payments commencing at a date other than the date of initial occupancy, the Company records minimum rental expenses on a straight-line basis over the terms of the leases in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The Company has the option to extend or renew most of its leases which may increase the future minimum lease commitments.\n\nBecause the terms of the Company’s facilities lease agreements for its original Los Gatos, California headquarters site required the Company’s involvement in the construction funding of the buildings, the Company is the “deemed owner” (for accounting purposes only) of these buildings. Accordingly, the Company recorded an asset of $41 million, representing the total costs of the buildings and improvements, including the costs paid by the lessor (the legal owner of the buildings), with corresponding liabilities. Upon completion of construction of each building, the Company did not meet the sale-leaseback criteria for de-recognition of the building assets and liabilities. Therefore the leases are accounted for as financing obligations. At December\xa031, 2018, the lease financing obligation balance was $28 million, the majority of which is recorded in “Other non-current liabilities,” on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The remaining future minimum payments under the lease financing obligation are $11 million. The lease financing obligation balance at the end of the lease term will be approximately $22 million which approximates the net book value of the buildings to be relinquished to the lessor.\n\nIn addition to the lease financing obligation, future minimum lease payments include $1,157 million as of December\xa031, 2018 related to non-cancelable operating leases for the expanded headquarters in Los Gatos, California and the office space in Los Angeles, California.\n\nFuture minimum payments under lease financing obligations and non-cancelable operating leases as of December\xa031, 2018 are as follows:\n\n|  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | | | |\n|  |  |  |  |\n| Year Ending December\xa031, | Future  Minimum  Payments | | |\n|  | (in\xa0thousands) | | |\n| 2019 | $ | 172,470 |  |\n| 2020 | 139,366 | |  |\n| 2021 | 145,175 | |  |\n| 2022 | 156,527 | |  |\n| 2023 | 151,200 | |  |\n| Thereafter | 943,630 | |  |\n| Total minimum payments | $ | 1,708,368 |  |\n\nRent expense associated with the operating leases was $107 million, $75 million and $53 million for the years ended December\xa031, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.\n\nLegal Proceedings\n\nFrom time to time, in the normal course of its operations, the Company is subject to litigation matters and claims, including claims relating to employee relations, business practices and patent infringement. Litigation can be expensive and disruptive to normal business operations. Moreover, the results of complex legal proceedings are difficult to predict and the Company's view of these matters may change in the future as the litigation and events related thereto unfold. The Company expenses legal fees as incurred. The Company records a provision for contingent losses when it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. An unfavorable outcome to any legal matter, if material, could have an adverse effect on the Company's operations or its financial position, liquidity or results of operations.\n\nThe Company is involved in litigation matters not listed herein but does not consider the matters to be material either individually or in the aggregate at this time. The Company's view of the matters not listed may change in the future as the litigation and events related thereto unfold.\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  |  |\n| 6. | Guarantees—Indemnification Obligations |\n\n54", 'Table of Contents\n\nIn the ordinary course of business, the Company has entered into contractual arrangements under which it has agreed to provide indemnification of varying scope and terms to business partners and other parties with respect to certain matters, including, but not limited to, losses arising out of the Company’s breach of such agreements and out of intellectual property infringement claims made by third parties. In these circumstances, payment may be conditional on the other party making a claim pursuant to the procedures specified in the particular contract.\n\nThe Company’s obligations under these agreements may be limited in terms of time or amount, and in some instances, the Company may have recourse against third parties for certain payments. In addition, the Company has entered into indemnification agreements with its directors and certain of its officers that will require it, among other things, to indemnify them against certain liabilities that may arise by reason of their status or service as directors or officers. The terms of such obligations vary.\n\nIt is not possible to make a reasonable estimate of the maximum potential amount of future payments under these or similar agreements due to the conditional nature of the Company’s obligations and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular agreement.

The Company believes that implied volatility of publicly traded options in its common stock is more reflective of market conditions, and given consistently high trade volumes of the options, can reasonably be expected to be a better indicator of expected volatility than historical volatility of its common stock.\n\nIn valuing shares issued under the Company’s employee stock option plans, the Company bases the risk-free interest rate on U.S. Treasury zero-coupon issues with terms similar to the contractual term of the options. The Company does not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future and therefore uses an expected dividend yield of\xa0zero\xa0in the option valuation model. The Company does not use a post-vesting termination rate as options are fully vested upon grant date.\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  |  |\n| 8. | Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss |\n\nThe following table summarizes the changes in accumulated balances of other comprehensive loss, net of tax:\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | | | | | | | | | | | |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|  | Foreign currency | | |  | Change in unrealized gains on available-for-sale securities | | |  | Total | | |\n|  | (in thousands) | | | | | | | | | | |\n| Balances as of December 31, 2016 | $ | (47,966 | ) |  | $ | (599 | ) |  | $ | (48,565 | ) |\n| Other comprehensive income before reclassifications | 27,409 | |  |  | 728 | |  |  | 28,137 | |  |\n| Amounts reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive (loss) income | — | |  |  | (129 | | ) |  | (129 | | ) |\n| Net decrease in other comprehensive loss | 27,409 | |  |  | 599 | |  |  | 28,008 | |  |\n| Balances as of December 31, 2017 | $ | (20,557 | ) |  | $ | — |  |  | $ | (20,557 | ) |\n| Other comprehensive income before reclassifications | 975 | |  |  | — | |  |  | 975 | |  |\n| Net decrease in other comprehensive loss | 975 | |  |  | — | |  |  | 975 | |  |\n| Balances as of December 31, 2018 | $ | (19,582 | ) |  | $ | — |  |  | $ | (19,582 | ) |\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  |  |\n| 9. | Income Taxes |\n\nIncome before provision for income taxes was as follows:\n\n57', 'Table of Contents\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | | | | | | | | | | | |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|  | Year Ended December\xa031, | | | | | | | | | | |\n|  | 2018 | | |  | 2017 | | |  | 2016 | | |\n|  | (in thousands) | | | | | | | | | | |\n| United States | $ | 845,402 |  |  | $ | 144,100 |  |  | $ | 188,078 |  |\n| Foreign | 381,056 | |  |  | 341,221 | |  |  | 72,429 | |  |\n| Income before income taxes | $ | 1,226,458 |  |  | $ | 485,321 |  |  | $ | 260,507 |  |\n\nThe components of provision for (benefit from) income taxes for all periods presented were as follows:\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | | | | | | | | | | | |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|  | Year Ended December\xa031, | | | | | | | | | | |\n|  | 2018 | | |  | 2017 | | |  | 2016 | | |\n|  | (in thousands) | | | | | | | | | | |\n| Current tax provision: |  | | |  |  | | |  |  | | |\n| Federal | $ | (22,176 | ) |  | $ | 54,245 |  |  | $ | 54,315 |  |\n| State | (10,234 | | ) |  | (7,601 | | ) |  | 5,790 | |  |\n| Foreign | 133,146 | |  |  | 88,436 | |  |  | 60,571 | |  |\n| Total current | 100,736 | |  |  | 135,080 | |  |  | 120,676 | |  |\n| Deferred tax provision: |  | | |  |  | | |  |  | | |\n| Federal | (37,396 | | ) |  | (153,963 | | ) |  | (24,383 | | ) |\n| State | (52,391 | | ) |  | (52,695 | | ) |  | (14,080 | | ) |\n| Foreign | 4,267 | |  |  | (2,030 | | ) |  | (8,384 | | ) |\n| Total deferred | (85,520 | | ) |  | (208,688 | | ) |  | (46,847 | | ) |\n| Provision for (benefit from) income taxes | $ | 15,216 |  |  | $ | (73,608 | ) |  | $ | 73,829 |  |\n\nOn December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the “Act”) was signed into law making significant changes to the Internal Revenue Code.

In accordance with the Act, the Company recorded $79 million as additional income tax expense in the fourth quarter of 2017, the period in which the legislation was enacted. The total expense included $32 million related to the transition tax and $47 million related to the remeasurement of certain deferred tax assets and liabilities. Additionally, Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 ("SAB 118") was issued to address the application of U.S. GAAP in situations when a registrant does not have the necessary information available, prepared, or analyzed (including computations) in reasonable detail to complete the accounting for certain income tax effects of the Act. December 22, 2018 marked the end of the measurement period for purposes of SAB 118. As such, the Company has completed the analysis based on legislative updates relating to the Act currently available which resulted in an additional SAB 118 tax benefit of $34 million in the fourth quarter of 2018 and a total tax benefit of $72 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The total tax provision benefit included $45 million related to adjustments to the transition tax and a $27 million benefit related to the remeasurement of certain deferred tax assets and liabilities.\n\n58', 'Table of Contents\n\nA reconciliation of the provision for income taxes, with the amount computed by applying the statutory Federal income tax rate to income before income taxes is as follows:\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | | | | | | | | | | | |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|  | Year Ended December\xa031, | | | | | | | | | | |\n|  | 2018 | | |  | 2017 | | |  | 2016 | | |\n|  | (in thousands) | | | | | | | | | | |\n| Expected tax expense at U.S. Federal statutory rates | $ | 257,556 |  |  | $ | 169,860 |  |  | $ | 91,179 |  |\n| State income taxes, net of Federal income tax effect | 33,611 | |  |  | 6,404 | |  |  | 7,261 | |  |\n| Foreign earnings at other than U.S. rates | 63,519 | |  |  | (87,514 | | ) |  | 14,639 | |  |\n| Federal and California R&D tax credits | (140,749 | | ) |  | (79,868 | | ) |  | (41,144 | | ) |\n| Excess tax benefits on stock-based compensation | (191,323 | | ) |  | (157,888 | | ) |  | — | |  |\n| Impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 |  | | |  |  | | |  |  | | |\n| Rate Change / Transition Tax | (71,516 | | ) |  | 79,077 | |  |  | — | |  |\n| U.S. Minimum Tax on Foreign Entities | 43,099 | |  |  | — | |  |  | — | |  |\n| Nondeductible Officers Compensation | 14,377 | |  |  | 28 | |  |  | 28 | |  |\n| Other | 6,642 | |  |  | (3,707 | | ) |  | 1,866 | |  |\n| Provision for (benefit from) income taxes | $ | 15,216 |  |  | $ | (73,608 | ) |  | $ | 73,829 |  |\n| Effective Tax Rate | 1 | | % |  | (15 | | )% |  | 28 | | % |\n\nThe components of deferred tax assets and liabilities were as follows:\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | | | | | | | |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|  | As of\xa0December\xa031, | | | | | | |\n|  | 2018 | | |  | 2017 | | |\n|  | (in thousands) | | | | | | |\n| Deferred tax assets: |  | | |  |  | | |\n| Stock-based compensation | $ | 190,451 |  |  | $ | 149,367 |  |\n| Depreciation and amortization | (151,678 | | ) |  | (70,382 | | ) |\n| Federal and California tax R&D credits | 369,023 | |  |  | 260,686 | |  |\n| Foreign tax credits | 218,026 | |  |  | 102,242 | |  |\n| Accruals and reserves | 36,396 | |  |  | 34,170 | |  |\n| Other | 27,203 | |  |  | 51,614 | |  |\n| Gross deferred tax assets | 689,421 | |  |  | 527,697 | |  |\n| Valuation allowance | (124,996 | | ) |  | (49,431 | | ) |\n| Net deferred tax assets | $ | 564,425 |  |  | $ | 478,266 |  |\n\nAll deferred tax assets are classified as “Other non-current assets” on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December\xa031, 2018 and December\xa031, 2017.

Interest and penalties included in the Company's provision for income taxes were not material in all the periods presented.\n\nThe Company files U.S. Federal, state and foreign tax returns. In August 2018, the Company reached a favorable settlement with the IRS for tax years 2014 & 2015 and recorded a discrete tax benefit of $7 million in the third quarter of 2018. The Company is currently under examination by the IRS for the years 2016 and 2017 and the state of California for the years 2014 and 2015.  The 2009 through 2017 state tax returns are subject to examination by state tax authorities. The Company is also currently under examination in the UK for 2015 and 2016. The Company has no other significant foreign jurisdiction audits underway. The years 2013 through 2017 remain subject to examination by foreign tax authorities.\n\nGiven the potential outcome of the current examinations as well as the impact of the current examinations on the potential expiration of the statute of limitations, it is reasonably possible that the balance of unrecognized tax benefits could significantly change within the next twelve months. However, an estimate of the range of reasonably possible adjustments cannot be made at this time.\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  |  |\n| 10. | Employee Benefit Plan |\n\nThe Company maintains a 401(k) savings plan covering substantially all of its employees. Eligible employees may contribute up to 80% of their annual salary through payroll deductions, but not more than the statutory limits set by the Internal Revenue Service. The Company matches employee contributions at the discretion of the Board. During 2018, 2017 and 2016, the Company’s matching contributions totaled $27 million, $20 million and $16 million, respectively.\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  |  |\n| 11. | Segment Information |\n\nThe Company has three reportable segments: Domestic streaming, International streaming and Domestic DVD. Segment information is presented in the same manner that the Company’s chief operating decision maker (“CODM”) reviews the operating results in assessing performance and allocating resources. The Company’s CODM reviews revenue and contribution profit (loss) for each of the reportable segments. Contribution profit (loss) is defined as revenues less cost of revenues and marketing expenses incurred by the segment. The Company has aggregated the results of the International operating segments into one reportable segment because these operating segments share similar long-term economic and other qualitative characteristics. As markets within the Company's International streaming segment become profitable, the CODM increasingly focuses on the Company's global operating margin as a measure of profitability.\n\nThe Domestic streaming segment derives revenues from monthly membership fees for services related to streaming content to the members in the United States. The International streaming segment derives revenues from monthly membership fees for services related to streaming content to members outside of the United States. The Domestic DVD segment derives revenues from monthly membership fees for services consisting solely of DVD-by-mail. Revenues and the related payment processing fees are attributed to the operating segment based on the nature of the underlying membership (streaming or DVD) and the geographic region from which the membership originates. There are no internal revenue transactions between the Company’s segments.\n\nAmortization of streaming content assets makes up the majority of cost of revenues. The Company obtains multi-territory or global rights for its streaming content and allocates these rights between Domestic and International streaming segments based on estimated fair market value. Amortization of content assets and other expenses associated with the acquisition, licensing, and production of streaming content for each streaming segment thus includes both expenses directly incurred by the\n\n60", "Table of Contents\n\nsegment as well as an allocation of expenses incurred for global or multi-territory rights. Other costs of revenues such as delivery costs are either attributed to the operating segment based on amounts directly incurred by the segment or are allocated across segments by management. Marketing expenses consist primarily of advertising expenses and certain payments made to marketing partners, including CE manufacturers, MVPDs, mobile operators and ISPs, which are generally included in the segment in which the expenditures are directly incurred.\n\nThe Company's long-lived tangible assets were located as follows:\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

provided, and that is not part of a free trial or other promotional offering by the Company to certain new and rejoining members. A membership is canceled and ceases to be reflected in the above metrics as of the effective cancellation date. Voluntary cancellations generally become effective at the end of the prepaid membership period. Involuntary cancellation of the service, as a result of a failed method of payment, becomes effective immediately. Memberships are assigned to territories based on the geographic location used at time of sign-up as determined by the Company’s internal systems, which utilize industry standard geo-location technology. |\n\n12.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Reclassification\n\nThe Company reclassified certain streaming personnel-related expenses on its Consolidated Statement of Operations effective for the fourth quarter of 2018. Specifically, expenses for personnel that support global content and marketing that were previously classified in General and administrative expenses were reclassified to Cost of revenues and Marketing, respectively. In addition, expenses for personnel that support global streaming delivery that were previously classified in Technology and development were also reclassified to Cost of revenues. The Company is making this change in classification in order to reflect how the nature of the work performed by certain personnel has changed to be more directly related to the development, marketing and delivery of our service as a result of the continued evolution of the Company’s strategy to self-produce and create more of its own content rather than license or procure it from third parties. This change in classification will also align external presentation of personnel-related expenses with the way that the Company's chief operating decision maker expects to assess profitability and make resource allocation decisions going forward. The Company has reclassified these personnel-related expenses for all prior periods in order to present comparable financial results. There is no change to consolidated operating income, net income or cash flows or DVD segment results as a result of this change in classification.\n\nThe revised Consolidated Statements of Operations as well as segment results for the three month periods ended March 31, 2016, 2017 and 2018, June 30, 2016, 2017 and 2018, September 30, 2016, 2017 and 2018 and December 31, 2016 and 2017 and for the

(“Netflix”, “the Company”, “we”, or “us”) is the world’s leading internet television network with over 117 million streaming memberships in over 190 countries enjoying more than 140 million hours of TV shows and movies per day, including original series, documentaries and feature films. Our members can watch as much as they want, anytime, anywhere, on nearly any internet-connected screen. Members can play, pause and resume watching, all without commercials or commitments. Additionally, in the United States ("U.S."), our members can receive DVDs delivered quickly to their homes.\n\nWe are a pioneer in the internet delivery of TV shows and movies, launching our streaming service in 2007. Since this launch, we have developed an ecosystem for internet-connected screens and have added increasing amounts of content that enable consumers to enjoy TV shows and movies directly on their internet-connected screens. As a result of these efforts, we have experienced growing consumer acceptance of, and interest in, the delivery of TV shows and movies directly over the internet.\n\nOur core strategy is to grow our streaming membership business globally within the parameters of our profit margin targets. We are continuously improving our members\' experience by expanding our streaming content with a focus on a programming mix of content that delights our members. In addition, we are continuously enhancing our user interface and extending our streaming service to more internet-connected screens. Our members can download a selection of titles for offline viewing.\n\nWe continue to grow our streaming service both domestically and internationally. We began our international expansion with Canada in 2010 and have since launched our service globally, with the exception of The People\'s Republic of China and territories where U.S. companies are not allowed to operate. We have also expanded our streaming content offering to include more exclusive and original programming, including several Emmy, Golden Globe and Academy Award winning original series and documentaries. Our original programming increasingly includes content that we produce.\n\nBUSINESS SEGMENTS\n\nThe Company has three reportable segments: Domestic streaming, International streaming and Domestic DVD. The Domestic streaming segment derives revenues from monthly membership fees for services consisting solely of streaming content to our members in the United States. The International streaming segment derives revenues from monthly membership fees for services consisting solely of streaming content to our members outside the United States. The Domestic DVD segment derives revenues from monthly membership fees for services consisting solely of DVD-by-mail. For additional information regarding our segments, including information about our financial results by geography, see Note 11 Segment Information in the accompanying notes to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8, "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n\n1', 'Table of Contents\n\nCOMPETITION\n\nThe market for entertainment video is intensely competitive and subject to rapid change. We compete against other entertainment video providers, such as multichannel video programming distributors ("MVPDs"), internet-based content providers (including those that provide pirated content), video gaming providers and DVD retailers and more broadly against other sources of entertainment that our members could choose in their moments of free time. We also compete against entertainment video providers and content producers in obtaining content for our service, both for licensed streaming content and for original content projects.\n\nWhile consumers may maintain simultaneous relationships with multiple entertainment sources, we strive for consumers to choose us in their moments of free time. We have often referred to this choice as our objective of "winning moments of truth." In attempting to win these moments of truth with our members, we are continually improving our service, including both our technology and our content, which is increasingly exclusive and curated, and includes our own original programming.\n\nSEASONALITY\n\nOur membership growth exhibits a seasonal pattern that reflects variations when consumers buy internet-connected screens and when they tend to increase their viewing. Historically, the first and fourth quarters (October through March) represent our greatest membership growth across our Domestic and International streaming segments. Increasingly, our membership growth is impacted by the release of certain high-profile original content. Internationally, we expect each market to demonstrate more predictable seasonal patterns as our service offering in each market becomes more established and we have a longer history to assess such patterns.\n\nINTELLECTUAL PROPERTY\n\nWe regard our trademarks, service marks, copyrights, patents, domain names, trade dress, trade secrets, proprietary technologies and similar intellectual property as important to our success. We use a combination of patent, trademark, copyright and trade secret laws and confidentiality agreements to protect our proprietary intellectual property. Our ability to protect and enforce our intellectual property rights is subject to certain risks and from time to time we encounter disputes over rights and obligations concerning intellectual property. We cannot provide assurance that we will prevail in any intellectual property disputes.\n\nEMPLOYEES\n\nAs of December\xa031, 2017, we had approximately 5,500 total employees. Of these employees, approximately 5,400 were full-time, including approximately 600 categorized as temporary.\n\nOTHER INFORMATION\n\nWe were incorporated in Delaware in August 1997 and completed our initial public offering in May 2002. Our principal executive offices are located at 100 Winchester Circle, Los Gatos, California 95032, and our telephone number is (408)\xa0540-3700.\n\nWe maintain a Web site at www.netflix.com. The contents of our Web site are not incorporated in, or otherwise to be regarded as part of, this Annual Report on Form 10-K. In this Annual Report on Form 10-K, “Netflix,” the “Company,” “we,” “us,” “our” and the “registrant” refer to Netflix, Inc. We make available, free of charge on our Web site, access to our Annual Report on Form 10-K, our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, our Current Reports on Form 8-K and amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), as soon as reasonably practicable after we file or furnish them electronically with the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC").\n\nInvestors and others should note that we announce material financial information to our investors using our investor relations Web site (http://ir.netflix.com), SEC filings, press releases, public conference calls and webcasts. We use these channels as well as social media to communicate with our members and the public about our company, our services and other issues. It is possible that the information we post on social media could be deemed to be material information. Therefore, we encourage investors, the media, and others interested in our company to review the information we post on the social media channels listed on our investor relations Web site.\n\n2', 'Table of Contents\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  |  |\n| Item 1A. | Risk Factors |\n\nIf any of the following risks actually occur, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be harmed. In that case, the trading price of our common stock could decline, and you could lose all or part of your investment.\n\nRisks Related to Our Business\n\nIf our efforts to attract and retain members are not successful, our business will be adversely affected.\n\nWe have experienced significant membership growth over the past several years. Our ability to continue to attract members will depend in part on our ability to consistently provide our members with compelling content choices, as well as a quality experience for selecting and viewing TV shows and movies. Furthermore, the relative service levels, content offerings, pricing and related features of competitors to our service may adversely impact our ability to attract and retain memberships. Competitors include other entertainment video providers, such as MVPDs, internet-based movie and TV content providers (including those that provide pirated content) and DVD retailers. If consumers do not perceive our service offering to be of value, including if we introduce new or adjust existing features, adjust pricing or service offerings, or change the mix of content in a manner that is not favorably received by them, we may not be able to attract and retain members. In addition, many of our members rejoin our service or originate from word-of-mouth advertising from existing members. If our efforts to satisfy our existing members are not successful, we may not be able to attract members, and as a result, our ability to maintain and/or grow our business will be adversely affected. Members cancel our service for many reasons, including a perception that they do not use the service sufficiently, the need to cut household expenses, availability of content is unsatisfactory, competitive services provide a better value or experience and customer service issues are not satisfactorily resolved. We must continually add new memberships both to replace canceled memberships and to grow our business beyond our current membership base. If we do not grow as expected, given, in particular that our content costs are largely fixed in nature and contracted over several years, we may not be able to adjust our expenditures or increase our (per membership) revenues commensurate with the lowered growth rate such that our margins, liquidity and results of operation may be adversely impacted. If we are unable to successfully compete with current and new competitors in both retaining our existing memberships and attracting new memberships, our business will be adversely affected. Further, if excessive numbers of members cancel our service, we may be required to incur significantly higher marketing expenditures than we currently anticipate to replace these members with new members.\n\nChanges in competitive offerings for entertainment video, including the potential rapid adoption of piracy-based video offerings, could adversely impact our business.\n\nThe market for entertainment video is intensely competitive and subject to rapid change. Through new and existing distribution channels, consumers have increasing options to access entertainment video. The various economic models underlying these channels include subscription, transactional, ad-supported and piracy-based models. All of these have the potential to capture meaningful segments of the entertainment video market. Piracy, in particular, threatens to damage our business, as its fundamental proposition to consumers is so compelling and difficult to compete against: virtually all content for free. Furthermore, in light of the compelling consumer proposition, piracy services are subject to rapid global growth. Traditional providers of entertainment video, including broadcasters and cable network operators, as well as internet based e-commerce or entertainment video providers are increasing their internet-based video offerings. Several of these competitors have long operating histories, large customer bases, strong brand recognition and significant financial, marketing and other resources. They may secure better terms from suppliers, adopt more aggressive pricing and devote more resources to product development, technology, infrastructure, content acquisitions and marketing. New entrants may enter the market or existing providers may adjust their services with unique offerings or approaches to providing entertainment video. Companies also may enter into business combinations or alliances that strengthen their competitive positions. If we are unable to successfully or profitably compete with current and new competitors, our business will be adversely affected, and we may not be able to increase or maintain market share, revenues or profitability.\n\nThe long-term and fixed cost nature of our content commitments may limit our operating flexibility and could adversely affect our liquidity and results of operations.\n\nIn connection with licensing streaming content, we typically enter into multi-year commitments with studios and other content providers. We also enter into multi-year commitments for content that we produce, either directly or through third parties, including elements associated with these production such as non-cancelable commitments under talent agreements. The payment terms of these agreements are not tied to member usage or the size of our membership base (“fixed cost”) but may be determined by costs of production or tied to such factors as titles licensed and/or theatrical exhibition receipts. Such commitments, to the extent estimable under accounting standards, are included in the Contractual Obligations section of Part II,\n\n3', 'Table of Contents\n\nItem 7, "Management\'s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" and Note 5, Commitments and Contingencies in the accompanying notes to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8, "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Given the multiple-year duration and largely fixed cost nature of content commitments, if membership acquisition and retention do not meet our expectations, our margins may be adversely impacted. Payment terms for certain content commitments, such as content we directly produce, will typically require more up-front cash payments than other content licenses or arrangements whereby we do not cashflow the production of such content. To the extent membership and/or revenue growth do not meet our expectations, our liquidity and results of operations could be adversely affected as a result of content commitments and accelerated payment requirements of certain agreements. In addition, the long-term and fixed cost nature of our content commitments may limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to changes in our business and the market segments in which we operate. If we license and/or produce content that is not favorably received by consumers in a territory, or is unable to be shown in a territory, acquisition and retention may be adversely impacted and given the long-term and fixed cost nature of our content commitments, we may not be able to adjust our content offering quickly and our results of operation may be adversely impacted.\n\nWe face risks, such as unforeseen costs and potential liability in connection with content we acquire, produce, license and/or distribute through our service.\n\nAs a producer and distributor of content, we face potential liability for negligence, copyright and trademark infringement, or other claims based on the nature and content of materials that we acquire, produce, license and/or distribute. We also may face potential liability for content used in promoting our service, including marketing materials. We are devoting more resources toward the development, production, marketing and distribution of original programming, including TV series and movies. We believe that original programming can help differentiate our service from other offerings, enhance our brand and otherwise attract and retain members. To the extent our original programming does not meet our expectations, in particular, in terms of costs, viewing and popularity, our business, including our brand and results of operations may be adversely impacted. As we expand our original programming, we have become responsible for production costs and other expenses, such as ongoing guild payments. We also take on risks associated with production, such as completion and key talent risk. Negotiations or renewals related to entertainment industry collective bargaining agreements could negatively impact timing and costs associated with our productions. To the extent we create and sell physical or digital merchandise relating to our original programming, and/or license such rights to third parties, we could become subject to product liability, intellectual property or other claims related to such merchandise. We may decide to remove content from our service, not to place licensed or produced content on our service or discontinue or alter production of original content if we believe such content might not be well received by our members or could be damaging to our brand.\n\nTo the extent we do not accurately anticipate costs or mitigate risks, including for content that we obtain but ultimately does not appear on or is removed from our service, or if we become liable for content we acquire, produce, license and/or distribute, our business may suffer. Litigation to defend these claims could be costly and the expenses and damages arising from any liability or unforeseen production risks could harm our results of operations. We may not be indemnified against claims or costs of these types and we may not have insurance coverage for these types of claims.\n\nIf studios, content providers or other rights holders refuse to license streaming content or other rights upon terms acceptable to us, our business could be adversely affected.\n\nOur ability to provide our members with content they can watch depends on studios, content providers and other rights holders licensing rights to distribute such content and certain related elements thereof, such as the public performance of music contained within the content we distribute. The license periods and the terms and conditions of such licenses vary. If the studios, content providers and other rights holders are not or are no longer willing or able to license us content upon terms acceptable to us, our ability to stream content to our members will be adversely affected and/or our costs could increase. Certain licenses for content provide for the studios or other content providers to withdraw content from our service relatively quickly. Because of these provisions as well as other actions we may take, content available through our service can be withdrawn on short notice. As competition increases, we may see the cost of programming increase. As we seek to differentiate our service, we are increasingly focused on securing certain exclusive rights when obtaining content, including original content. We are also focused on programming an overall mix of content that delights our members in a cost efficient manner. Within this context, we are selective about the titles we add and renew to our service. If we do not maintain a compelling mix of content, our membership acquisition and retention may be adversely affected.\n\nMusic and certain authors\' performances contained within content we distribute may require us to obtain licenses for such distribution. In this regard, we engage in negotiations with collection management organizations (“CMOs”) that hold certain rights to music and/or other interests in connection with streaming content into various territories. If we are unable to reach\n\n4', 'Table of Contents\n\nmutually acceptable terms with these organizations, we could become involved in litigation and/or could be enjoined from distributing certain content, which could adversely impact our business. Additionally, pending and ongoing litigation as well as negotiations between certain CMOs and other third parties in various territories could adversely impact our negotiations with CMOs, or result in music publishers represented by certain CMOs unilaterally withdrawing rights, and thereby adversely impact our ability to reach licensing agreements reasonably acceptable to us. Failure to reach such licensing agreements could expose us to potential liability for copyright infringement or otherwise increase our costs.\n\nIf we are not able to manage change and growth, our business could be adversely affected.\n\nWe are expanding our operations internationally, scaling our streaming service to effectively and reliably handle anticipated growth in both members and features related to our service, ramping up our ability to produce original content, as well as continuing to operate our DVD service within the U.S. As our international offering evolves, we are managing and adjusting our business to address varied content offerings, consumer customs and practices, in particular those dealing with e-commerce and internet video, as well as differing legal and regulatory environments. As we scale our streaming service, we are developing technology and utilizing third-party “cloud” computing services. As we ramp up our original content production, we are building out expertise in a number of disciplines, including creative, marketing, legal, finance, licensing, merchandising and other resources related to the development and physical production of content. If we are not able to manage the growing complexity of our business, including improving, refining or revising our systems and operational practices related to our streaming operations and original content, our business may be adversely affected.\n\nWe could be subject to economic, political, regulatory and other risks arising from our international operations.\n\nOperating in international markets requires significant resources and management attention and will subject us to regulatory, economic and political risks that may be different from or incremental to those in the U.S. In addition to the risks that we face in the U.S., our international operations involve risks that could adversely affect our business, including:\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  |  |\n| • | the need to adapt our content and user interfaces for specific cultural and language differences, including licensing a certain portion of our content assets before we have developed a full appreciation for its performance within a given territory; |\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  |  |\n| • | difficulties and costs associated with staffing and managing foreign operations; |\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  |  |\n| • | management distraction; |\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  |  |\n| • | political or social unrest and economic instability; |\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  |  |\n| • | compliance with U.S. laws such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, export controls and economic sanctions, and local laws prohibiting corrupt payments to government officials; |\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  |  |\n| • | difficulties in understanding and complying with local laws, regulations and customs in foreign jurisdictions; |\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  |  |\n| • | regulatory requirements or government action against our service, whether in response to enforcement of actual or purported legal and regulatory requirements or otherwise, that results in disruption or non-availability of our service or particular content in the applicable jurisdiction; |\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  |  |\n| • | less favorable foreign intellectual property laws; |\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  |  |\n| • | adverse tax consequences such as those related to changes in tax laws or tax rates or their interpretations, and the related application of judgment in determining our global provision for income taxes, deferred tax assets or liabilities or other tax liabilities given the ultimate tax determination is uncertain; |\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  |  |\n| • | fluctuations in currency exchange rates, which we do not use foreign exchange contracts or derivatives to hedge against and which could impact revenues and expenses of our international operations and expose us to foreign currency exchange rate risk; |\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  |  |\n| • | profit repatriation and other restrictions on the transfer of funds; |\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  |  |\n| • | differing payment processing systems as well as consumer use and acceptance of electronic payment methods, such as payment cards; |\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  |  |\n| • | new and different sources of competition; |\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  |  |\n| • | censorship requirements that cause us to remove or edit popular content, leading to consumer disappointment or dissatisfaction with our service; |\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  |  |\n| • | low usage and/or penetration of internet-connected consumer electronic devices; |\n\n5', 'Table of Contents\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  |  |\n| • | different and more stringent user protection, data protection, privacy and other laws, including data localization requirements; |\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  |  |\n| • | availability of reliable broadband connectivity and wide area networks in targeted areas for expansion; |\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  |  |\n| • | integration and operational challenges as well as potential unknown liabilities in connection with companies we may acquire or control; and |\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  |  |\n| • | differing, and often more lenient, laws and consumer understanding/attitudes regarding the illegality of piracy. |\n\nOur failure to manage any of these risks successfully could harm our international operations and our overall business, and results of our operations.\n\nWe are subject to taxation related risks in multiple jurisdictions.\n\nWe are a U.S.-based multinational company subject to tax in multiple U.S. and foreign tax jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in determining our global provision for income taxes, deferred tax assets or liabilities and in evaluating our tax positions on a worldwide basis. While we believe our tax positions are consistent with the tax laws in the jurisdictions in which we conduct our business, it is possible that these positions may be overturned by jurisdictional tax authorities, which may have a significant impact on our global provision for income taxes.\n\nTax laws are dynamic and subject to change as new laws are passed and new interpretations of the law are issued or applied. The U.S. recently enacted significant tax reform, and certain provisions of the new law may adversely affect us. In addition, governmental tax authorities are increasingly scrutinizing the tax positions of companies. Many countries in the European Union, as well as a number of other countries and organizations such as the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, are actively considering changes to existing tax laws that, if enacted, could increase our tax obligations in countries where we do business. If U.S. or other foreign tax authorities change applicable tax laws, our overall taxes could increase, and our business, financial condition or results of operations may be adversely impacted.\n\nIf we fail to maintain or, in newer markets establish, a positive reputation with consumers concerning our service, including the content we offer, we may not be able to attract or retain members, and our operating results may be adversely affected.\n\nWe believe that a positive reputation with consumers concerning our service is important in attracting and retaining members who have a number of choices from which to obtain entertainment video. To the extent our content, in particular, our original programming, is perceived as low quality, offensive or otherwise not compelling to consumers, our ability to establish and maintain a positive reputation may be adversely impacted. To the extent our content is deemed controversial or offensive by government regulators, we may face direct or indirect retaliatory action or behavior, including being required to remove such content from our service, our entire service could be banned and/or become subject to heightened regulatory scrutiny across our business and operations. Furthermore, to the extent our marketing, customer service and public relations efforts are not effective or result in negative consumer reaction, our ability to establish and maintain a positive reputation may likewise be adversely impacted. With newer markets, we also need to establish our reputation with consumers and to the extent we are not successful in creating positive impressions, our business in these newer markets may be adversely impacted.\n\nChanges in how we market our service could adversely affect our marketing expenses and membership levels may be adversely affected.\n\nWe utilize a broad mix of marketing and public relations programs, including social media sites, to promote our service to potential new members. We may limit or discontinue use or support of certain marketing sources or activities if advertising rates increase or if we become concerned that members or potential members deem certain marketing practices intrusive or damaging to our brand. If the available marketing channels are curtailed, our ability to attract new members may be adversely affected.\n\nCompanies that promote our service may decide that we negatively impact their business or may make business decisions that in turn negatively impact us. For example, if they decide that they want to compete more directly with us, enter a similar business or exclusively support our competitors, we may no longer have access to their marketing channels. We also acquire a number of members who rejoin our service having previously cancelled their membership. If we are unable to maintain or replace our sources of members with similarly effective sources, or if the cost of our existing sources increases, our member levels and marketing expenses may be adversely affected.\n\n6', "Table of Contents\n\nWe utilize marketing to promote our content and drive viewing by our members. To the extent we promote our content inefficiently or ineffectively, we may not obtain the expected acquisition and retention benefits and our business may be adversely affected.\n\nWe rely upon a number of partners to make our service available on their devices.\n\nWe currently offer members the ability to receive streaming content through a host of internet-connected screens, including TVs, digital video players, television set-top boxes and mobile devices. We have agreements with various cable, satellite and telecommunications operators to make our service available through the television set-top boxes of these service providers. In many instances, our agreements also including provisions by which the partner bills consumers directly for the Netflix service or otherwise offers services or products in connection with offering our service. We intend to continue to broaden our relationships with existing partners and to increase our capability to stream TV shows and movies to other platforms and partners over time. If we are not successful in maintaining existing and creating new relationships, or if we encounter technological, content licensing, regulatory, business or other impediments to delivering our streaming content to our members via these devices, our ability to retain members and grow our business could be adversely impacted.\n\nOur agreements with our partners are typically between one and three years in duration and our business could be adversely affected if, upon expiration, a number of our partners do not continue to provide access to our service or are unwilling to do so on terms acceptable to us, which terms may include the degree of accessibility and prominence of our service. Furthermore, devices are manufactured and sold by entities other than Netflix and while these entities should be responsible for the devices' performance, the connection between these devices and Netflix may nonetheless result in consumer dissatisfaction toward Netflix and such dissatisfaction could result in claims against us or otherwise adversely impact our business. In addition, technology changes to our streaming functionality may require that partners update their devices. If partners do not update or otherwise modify their devices, our service and our members' use and enjoyment could be negatively impacted.\n\nAny significant disruption in or unauthorized access to our computer systems or those of third parties that we utilize in our operations, including those relating to cybersecurity or arising from cyber-attacks, could result in a loss or degradation of service, unauthorized disclosure of data, including member and corporate information, or theft of intellectual property, including digital content assets, which could adversely impact our business.\n\nOur reputation and ability to attract, retain and serve our members is dependent upon the reliable performance and security of our computer systems and those of third parties that we utilize in our operations. These systems may be subject to damage or interruption from earthquakes, adverse weather conditions, other natural disasters, terrorist attacks, power loss, telecommunications failures, and cybersecurity risks. Interruptions in these systems, or with the internet in general, could make our service unavailable or degraded or otherwise hinder our ability to deliver streaming content or fulfill DVD selections. Service interruptions, errors in our software or the unavailability of computer systems used in our operations could diminish the overall attractiveness of our membership service to existing and potential members.\n\nOur computer systems and those of third parties we use in our operations are vulnerable to cybersecurity risks, including cyber-attacks, both from state-sponsored and individual activity, such as computer viruses, denial of service attacks, physical or electronic break-ins and similar disruptions. These systems periodically experience directed attacks intended to lead to interruptions and delays in our service and operations as well as loss, misuse or theft of data or intellectual property. Any attempt by hackers to obtain our data (including member and corporate information) or intellectual property (including digital content assets), disrupt our service, or otherwise access our systems, or those of third parties we use, if successful, could harm our business, be expensive to remedy and damage our reputation. We have implemented certain systems and processes to thwart hackers and protect our data and systems. From time to time, we have experienced an unauthorized release of certain digital content assets, however, to date these unauthorized releases have not had a material impact on our service or systems. There is no assurance that hackers may not have a material impact on our service or systems in the future. Our insurance does not cover expenses related to such disruptions or unauthorized access. Efforts to prevent hackers from disrupting our service or otherwise accessing our systems are expensive to implement and may limit the functionality of or otherwise negatively impact our service offering and systems. Any significant disruption to our service or access to our systems could result in a loss of memberships and adversely affect our business and results of operation.\n\nWe utilize our own communications and computer hardware systems located either in our facilities or in that of a third-party Web hosting provider. In addition, we utilize third-party “cloud” computing services in connection with our business operations. We also utilize our own and third-party content delivery networks to help us stream TV shows and movies in high volume to Netflix members over the internet. Problems faced by us or our third-party Web hosting, “cloud” computing, or other network providers, including technological or business-related disruptions, as well as cybersecurity threats, could adversely impact the experience of our members.\n\n7", 'Table of Contents\n\nWe rely upon Amazon Web Services to operate certain aspects of our service and any disruption of or interference with our use of the Amazon Web Services operation would impact our operations and our business would be adversely impacted.\n\nAmazon Web Services (“AWS”) provides a distributed computing infrastructure platform for business operations, or what is commonly referred to as a "cloud" computing service. We have architected our software and computer systems so as to utilize data processing, storage capabilities and other services provided by AWS. Currently, we run the vast majority of our computing on AWS. Given this, along with the fact that we cannot easily switch our AWS operations to another cloud provider, any disruption of or interference with our use of AWS would impact our operations and our business would be adversely impacted. While the retail side of Amazon competes with us, we do not believe that Amazon will use the AWS operation in such a manner as to gain competitive advantage against our service.\n\nIf the technology we use in operating our business fails, is unavailable, or does not operate to expectations, our business and results of operation could be adversely impacted.\n\nWe utilize a combination of proprietary and third party technology to operate our business. This includes the technology that we have developed to recommend and merchandise content to our consumers as well as enable fast and efficient delivery of content to our members and their various consumer electronic devices. For example, we have built and deployed our own content-delivery network (“CDN”). To the extent Internet Service Providers (“ISPs”) do not interconnect with our CDN, or if we experience difficulties in its operation, our ability to efficiently and effectively deliver our streaming content to our members could be adversely impacted and our business and results of operation could be adversely affected. Likewise, if our recommendation and merchandising technology does not enable us to predict and recommend titles that our members will enjoy, our ability to attract and retain members may be adversely affected. We also utilize third party technology to help market our service, process payments, and otherwise manage the daily operations of our business. If our technology or that of third parties we utilize in our operations fails or otherwise operates improperly, including as a result of “bugs” in our development and deployment of software, our ability to operate our service, retain existing members and add new members may be impaired. Any harm to our members\' personal computers or other devices caused by software used in our operations could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\n\nIf government regulations relating to the internet or other areas of our business change, we may need to alter the manner in which we conduct our business, or incur greater operating expenses.\n\nThe adoption or modification of laws or regulations relating to the internet or other areas of our business could limit or otherwise adversely affect the manner in which we currently conduct our business. As our service and others like us gain traction in international markets, governments are increasingly looking to introduce new or extend legacy regulations to these services, in particular those related to broadcast media and tax. In addition, the continued growth and development of the market for online commerce may lead to more stringent consumer protection laws, which may impose additional burdens on us. If we are required to comply with new regulations or legislation or new interpretations of existing regulations or legislation, this compliance could cause us to incur additional expenses or alter our business model.\n\nChanges in laws or regulations that adversely affect the growth, popularity or use of the internet, including laws impacting net neutrality, could decrease the demand for our service and increase our cost of doing business. Certain laws intended to prevent network operators from discriminating against the legal traffic that traverse their networks have been implemented in many countries, including across the European Union. In others, the laws may be nascent or non-existent. Furthermore, favorable laws may change, including for example, in the United States where net neutrality regulations were recently repealed. Given uncertainty around these rules, including changing interpretations, amendments or repeal, coupled with potentially significant political and economic power of local network operators, we could experience discriminatory or anti-competitive practices that could impede our growth, cause us to incur additional expense or otherwise negatively affect our business.\n\nChanges in how network operators handle and charge for access to data that travel across their networks could adversely impact our business.\n\nWe rely upon the ability of consumers to access our service through the internet. If network operators block, restrict or otherwise impair access to our service over their networks, our service and business could be negatively affected. To the extent that network operators implement usage based pricing, including meaningful bandwidth caps, or otherwise try to monetize access to their networks by data providers, we could incur greater operating expenses and our membership acquisition and retention could be negatively impacted. Furthermore, to the extent network operators create tiers of internet access service and either charge us for or prohibit us from being available through these tiers, our business could be negatively impacted.\n\n8', "Table of Contents\n\nMost network operators that provide consumers with access to the internet also provide these consumers with multichannel video programming. As such, many network operators have an incentive to use their network infrastructure in a manner adverse to our continued growth and success. While we believe that consumer demand, regulatory oversight and competition will help check these incentives, to the extent that network operators are able to provide preferential treatment to their data as opposed to ours or otherwise implement discriminatory network management practices, our business could be negatively impacted. The extent to which these incentives limit operator behavior differ across markets.\n\nPrivacy concerns could limit our ability to collect and leverage our membership data and disclosure of membership data could adversely impact our business and reputation.\n\nIn the ordinary course of business and in particular in connection with content acquisition and merchandising our service to our members, we collect and utilize data supplied by our members. We currently face certain legal obligations regarding the manner in which we treat such information. Other businesses have been criticized by privacy groups and governmental bodies for attempts to link personal identities and other information to data collected on the internet regarding users' browsing and other habits. Increased regulation of data utilization practices, including self-regulation or findings under existing laws that limit our ability to collect, transfer and use data, could have an adverse effect on our business. In addition, if we were to disclose data about our members in a manner that was objectionable to them, our business reputation could be adversely affected, and we could face potential legal claims that could impact our operating results. Internationally, we may become subject to additional and/or more stringent legal obligations concerning our treatment of customer and other personal information, such as laws regarding data localization and/or restrictions on data export. Failure to comply with these obligations could subject us to liability, and to the extent that we need to alter our business model or practices to adapt to these obligations, we could incur additional expenses.\n\nOur reputation and relationships with members would be harmed if our membership data, particularly billing data, were to be accessed by unauthorized persons.\n\nWe maintain personal data regarding our members, including names and billing data. This data is maintained on our own systems as well as that of third parties we use in our operations. With respect to billing data, such as credit card numbers, we rely on encryption and authentication technology to secure such information. We take measures to protect against unauthorized intrusion into our members' data. Despite these measures we, our payment processing services or other third party services we use such as AWS, could experience an unauthorized intrusion into our members' data. In the event of such a breach, current and potential members may become unwilling to provide the information to us necessary for them to become members. Additionally, we could face legal claims or regulatory fines or penalties for such a breach. The costs relating to any data breach could be material, and we currently do not carry insurance against the risk of a data breach. We also maintain employment and personal information concerning our employees, including those on our own productions. Should an unauthorized intrusion into our members' or employees' data occur, our business could be adversely affected and our larger reputation with respect to data protection could be negatively impacted.\n\nWe are subject to payment processing risk.\n\nOur members pay for our service using a variety of different payment methods, including credit and debit cards, gift cards, direct debit and online wallets. We rely on internal systems as well as those of third parties to process payment. Acceptance and processing of these payment methods are subject to certain rules and regulations and require payment of interchange and other fees. To the extent there are disruptions in our payment processing systems, increases in payment processing fees, material changes in the payment ecosystem, such as large re-issuances of payment cards, delays in receiving payments from payment processors and/or changes to rules or regulations concerning payment processing, our revenue, operating expenses and results of operation could be adversely impacted. In certain instances, we leverage third parties such as our cable and other partners to bill subscribers on our behalf. If these third parties become unwilling or unable to continue processing payments on our behalf, we would have to find alternative methods of collecting payments, which could adversely impact member acquisition and retention. In addition, from time to time, we encounter fraudulent use of payment methods, which could impact our results of operation and if not adequately controlled and managed could create negative consumer perceptions of our service.\n\n9", "Table of Contents\n\nIf our trademarks and other proprietary rights are not adequately protected to prevent use or appropriation by our competitors, the value of our brand and other intangible assets may be diminished, and our business may be adversely affected.\n\nWe rely and expect to continue to rely on a combination of confidentiality and license agreements with our employees, consultants and third parties with whom we have relationships, as well as trademark, copyright, patent and trade secret protection laws, to protect our proprietary rights. We may also seek to enforce our proprietary rights through court proceedings or other legal actions. We have filed and we expect to file from time to time for trademark and patent applications. Nevertheless, these applications may not be approved, third parties may challenge any copyrights, patents or trademarks issued to or held by us, third parties may knowingly or unknowingly infringe our intellectual property rights, and we may not be able to prevent infringement or misappropriation without substantial expense to us. If the protection of our intellectual property rights is inadequate to prevent use or misappropriation by third parties, the value of our brand and other intangible assets may be diminished, competitors may be able to more effectively mimic our service and methods of operations, the perception of our business and service to members and potential members may become confused in the marketplace, and our ability to attract members may be adversely affected.\n\nWe currently hold various domain names relating to our brand, including Netflix.com. Failure to protect our domain names could adversely affect our reputation and brand and make it more difficult for users to find our Web site and our service. We may be unable, without significant cost or at all, to prevent third parties from acquiring domain names that are similar to, infringe upon or otherwise decrease the value of our trademarks and other proprietary rights.\n\nIntellectual property claims against us could be costly and result in the loss of significant rights related to, among other things, our Web site, streaming technology, our recommendation and merchandising technology, title selection processes and marketing activities.\n\nTrademark, copyright, patent and other intellectual property rights are important to us and other companies. Our intellectual property rights extend to our technology, business processes and the content we produce and distribute through our our Web site. We use the intellectual property of third parties in creating some of our content, merchandising our products and marketing our service through contractual and other rights. From time to time, third parties allege that we have violated their intellectual property rights. If we are unable to obtain sufficient rights, successfully defend our use, or develop non-infringing technology or otherwise alter our business practices on a timely basis in response to claims against us for infringement, misappropriation, misuse or other violation of third-party intellectual property rights, our business and competitive position may be adversely affected. Many companies are devoting significant resources to developing patents that could potentially affect many aspects of our business. There are numerous patents that broadly claim means and methods of conducting business on the internet. We have not searched patents relative to our technology. Defending ourselves against intellectual property claims, whether they are with or without merit or are determined in our favor, results in costly litigation and diversion of technical and management personnel. It also may result in our inability to use our current Web site, streaming technology, our recommendation and merchandising technology or inability to market our service or merchandise our products. We may also have to remove content from our service. As a result of a dispute, we may have to develop non-infringing technology, enter into royalty or licensing agreements, adjust our content, merchandising or marketing activities or take other actions to resolve the claims. These actions, if required, may be costly or unavailable on terms acceptable to us.\n\nWe are engaged in legal proceedings that could cause us to incur unforeseen expenses and could occupy a significant amount of our management's time and attention.\n\nFrom time to time, we are subject to litigation or claims that could negatively affect our business operations and financial position. As we have grown, we have seen a rise in the number of litigation matters against us. These matters have included copyright and other claims related to our content, patent infringements as well as consumer and securities class actions, each of which are typically expensive to defend. Litigation disputes could cause us to incur unforeseen expenses, result in content unavailability, service disruptions and otherwise occupy a significant amount of our management's time and attention, any of which could negatively affect our business operations and financial position.\n\nWe may seek additional capital that may result in stockholder dilution or that may have rights senior to those of our common stockholders.\n\nFrom time to time, we may seek to obtain additional capital, either through equity, equity-linked or debt securities. Our cash flows provided by our operating activities have been negative in each of the last three years, primarily as a result of our decision to increase the amount of original streaming content available on our service. To the extent our cash flows from\n\n10", 'Table of Contents\n\noperations continue to be negative, we anticipate seeking additional capital. The decision to obtain additional capital will depend on, among other things, our business plans, operating performance and condition of the capital markets. If we raise additional funds through the issuance of equity, equity-linked or debt securities, those securities may have rights, preferences or privileges senior to the rights of our common stock, and our stockholders may experience dilution. Any large equity or equity-linked offering could also negatively impact our stock price.\n\nWe have a substantial amount of indebtedness and other obligations, including streaming content obligations, which could adversely affect our financial position.\n\nWe have a substantial amount of indebtedness and other obligations, including streaming content obligations. Moreover, we expect to incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future and to incur other obligations, including additional streaming content obligations. As of December\xa031, 2017, we had $6.5 billion aggregate principal amount of senior notes outstanding (“Notes”). In addition, we have entered into a revolving credit agreement that provides for a $500.0 million unsecured revolving credit facility. As of December\xa031, 2017, we have not borrowed any amount under this revolving credit facility. As of December\xa031, 2017, we had approximately $7.5 billion of total content liabilities as reflected on our consolidated balance sheet. Such amount does not include streaming content commitments that do not meet the criteria for liability recognition, the amounts of which are significant. For more information on our streaming content obligations, including those not on our consolidated balance sheet, see Note 5, Commitments and Contingencies in the accompanying notes to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8, "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Our substantial indebtedness and other obligations, including streaming content obligations, may:\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  |  |\n| • | make it difficult for us to satisfy our financial obligations, including making scheduled principal and interest payments on our Notes and our other obligations; |\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  |  |\n| • | limit our ability to borrow additional funds for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions or other general business purposes; |\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  |  |\n| • | limit our ability to use our cash flow or obtain additional financing for future working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions or other general business purposes; |\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  |  |\n| • | require us to use a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to make debt service payments and pay our other obligations when due; |\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  |  |\n| • | limit our flexibility to plan for, or react to, changes in our business and industry; |\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  |  |\n| • | place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our less leveraged competitors; and |\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  |  |\n| • | increase our vulnerability to the impact of adverse economic and industry conditions. |\n\nOur streaming obligations include large multi-year commitments. As a result, we may be unable to react to any downturn in the economy or reduction in our cash flows from operations by reducing our streaming content obligations in the near-term. This could result in our needing to access the capital markets at an unfavorable time, which may negatively impact our stock price\n\nWe may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service our debt and other obligations.\n\nOur ability to make payments on our debt, including our Notes, and our other obligations will depend on our financial and operating performance, which is subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions and to certain financial, business and other factors beyond our control. In each of the last three years, our cash flows from operating activities have been negative. We may be unable to attain a level of cash flows from operating activities sufficient to permit us to pay the principal, premium, if any, and interest on our debt, including the Notes, and other obligations, including amounts due under our streaming content obligations.\n\nIf we are unable to service our debt and other obligations from cash flows, we may need to refinance or restructure all or a portion of such obligations prior to maturity. Our ability to refinance or restructure our debt and other obligations will depend upon the condition of the capital markets and our financial condition at such time. Any refinancing or restructuring could be at higher interest rates and may require us to comply with more onerous covenants, which could further restrict our business operations. If our cash flows are insufficient to service our debt and other obligations, we may not be able to refinance or restructure any of these obligations on commercially reasonable terms or at all and any refinancing or restructuring could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition.\n\nIf our cash flows are insufficient to fund our debt and other obligations and we are unable to refinance or restructure these obligations, we could face substantial liquidity problems and may be forced to reduce or delay investments and capital expenditures, or to sell material assets or operations to meet our debt and other obligations. We cannot assure you that we would be able to implement any of these alternative measures on satisfactory terms or at all or that the proceeds from such\n\n11', "Table of Contents\n\nalternatives would be adequate to meet any debt or other obligations then due. If it becomes necessary to implement any of these alternative measures, our business, results of operations, or financial condition could be materially and adversely affected.\n\nWe may lose key employees or may be unable to hire qualified employees.\n\nWe rely on the continued service of our senior management, including our Chief Executive Officer and co-founder Reed Hastings, members of our executive team and other key employees and the hiring of new qualified employees. In our industry, there is substantial and continuous competition for highly-skilled business, product development, technical and other personnel. We may not be successful in recruiting new personnel and in retaining and motivating existing personnel, which may be disruptive to our operations.\n\nIf our Domestic DVD segment declines faster than anticipated, our business could be adversely affected.\n\nThe number of memberships to our DVD-by-mail offering is declining, and we anticipate that this decline will continue. We believe, however, that the domestic DVD business will continue to generate significant contribution profit for our business. The contribution profit generated by our domestic DVD business will help provide capital resources to fund growth or our streaming service. To the extent that the rate of decline in our DVD-by-mail business is greater than we anticipate, our business could be adversely affected. We do not anticipate increasing resources to our DVD operations and the technology used in its operations will not be meaningfully improved. To the extent that we experience service interruptions or other degradations in our DVD-by-mail service, members' satisfaction could be negatively impacted and we could experience an increase in DVD-by-mail member cancellations, which could adversely impact our business.\n\nIf the U.S. Postal Service were to increase postal delivery rates or implement other changes to improve its financial position, such as closing mail processing facilities or service reductions, such changes could lead to a decrease in customer satisfaction and our Domestic DVD segment's contribution profit could be adversely affected.\n\nRisks Related to Our Stock Ownership\n\nProvisions in our charter documents and under Delaware law could discourage a takeover that stockholders may consider favorable.\n\nOur charter documents may discourage, delay or prevent a merger or acquisition that a stockholder may consider favorable because they:\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  |  |\n| • | authorize our board of directors, without stockholder approval, to issue up to 10,000,000 shares of undesignated preferred stock; |\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  |  |\n| • | provide for a classified board of directors; |\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  |  |\n| • | prohibit our stockholders from acting by written consent; |\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  |  |\n| • | establish advance notice requirements for proposing matters to be approved by stockholders at stockholder meetings; and |\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  |  |\n| • | prohibit stockholders from calling a special meeting of stockholders. |\n\nAs a Delaware corporation, we are also subject to certain Delaware anti-takeover provisions. Under Delaware law, a corporation may not engage in a business combination with any holder of 15% or more of its capital stock unless the holder has held the stock for three years or, among other things, the board of directors has approved the transaction. Our board of directors could rely on Delaware law to prevent or delay an acquisition of us.\n\nIn addition, a merger or acquisition may trigger retention payments to certain executive employees under the terms of our Amended and Restated Executive Severance and Retention Incentive Plan, thereby increasing the cost of such a transaction.\n\nOur stock price is volatile.\n\nThe price at which our common stock has traded has fluctuated significantly. The price may continue to be volatile due to a number of factors including the following, some of which are beyond our control:\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  |  |\n| • | variations in our operating results, including our membership acquisition and retention, revenues, contribution profits, net income and free cash flow; |\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  |  |\n| • | variations between our actual operating results and the expectations of securities analysts, investors and the financial community; |\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  |  |\n| • | announcements of developments affecting our business, systems or expansion plans by us or others; |\n\n12", 'Table of Contents\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  |  |\n| • | competition, including the introduction of new competitors, their pricing strategies and services; |\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  |  |\n| • | market volatility in general; |\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  |  |\n| • | the level of demand for our stock, including the amount of short interest in our stock; and |\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  |  |\n| • | the operating results of our competitors. |\n\nAs a result of these and other factors, investors in our common stock may not be able to resell their shares at or above their original purchase price.\n\nFollowing certain periods of volatility in the market price of our securities, we became the subject of securities litigation. We may experience more such litigation following future periods of volatility. This type of litigation may result in substantial costs and a diversion of management’s attention and resources.\n\nPreparing and forecasting our financial results requires us to make judgments and estimates which may differ materially from actual results.\n\nGiven the dynamic nature of our business, and the inherent limitations in predicting the future, forecasts of our revenues, operating margins, net income and number of total and paid membership additions and other financial and operating data may differ materially from actual results. Such discrepancies could cause a decline in the trading price of our common stock. In addition, the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America also requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported periods. We base such estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, but actual results may differ from these estimates. For example, we estimate the period of use, beginning with the month of first availability, of any particular licensed or produced television series or movie based upon factors including historical and estimated viewing patterns in order to amortize these content assets. If we revise such estimates it could reduce the amortization period or result in impairment charges for the relevant content assets resulting in greater in-period expenses, which could cause us to miss our earnings guidance or negatively impact the results we report which could negatively impact our stock price.\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  |  |\n| Item 1B. | Unresolved Staff Comments |\n\nNone.\n\n13', 'Table of Contents\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  |  |\n| Item 2. | Properties |\n\nOur corporate headquarters are located in Los Gatos, California and consist of leased space aggregating approximately 600,000 square feet.\n\nIn the United States, we lease other offices in various locations, including approximately 400,000 square feet in Los Angeles, California for content acquisition, marketing and general and administrative operations and Fremont, California for our DVD operations.

International revenues as of the end of December 31, 2017 accounted for 44% of consolidated revenue for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to 36% of consolidated revenues for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase in consolidated revenues was primarily driven by the growth in the average number of paid streaming memberships globally, the majority of which was growth in our international memberships. Average paid international streaming memberships accounted for 49% of total average paid streaming memberships as of December\xa031, 2017, as compared to 43% of total average paid streaming memberships as of December\xa031, 2016. The impact from membership growth was coupled with an increase in global streaming average monthly revenue per paying membership resulting from price changes and plan mix.\n\nThe increase in operating income is due primarily to increased revenues partially offset by increased content expenses as we continue to acquire, license and produce content, including more Netflix originals. This increase in content expenses includes a $39.1 million expense related to unreleased content that we have abandoned. Headcount costs to support continued improvements in our streaming service, our international expansion and increased content production activities also increased. The increase in net income was comprised of an increase in operating income and an increase in the tax benefit primarily due to the adoption of ASU 2016-09 in the first quarter of 2017, partially offset by an increase in interest expense primarily due to the higher principal of notes outstanding and an increase in foreign exchange losses primarily due to the remeasurement of our euro denominated senior notes.\n\nWe offer three types of streaming membership plans. Our "basic" plan includes access to standard definition quality streaming on a single screen at a time. Our "standard" plan is our most popular streaming plan and includes access to high definition quality streaming on two screens concurrently. Our "premium" plan includes access to high definition and ultra-high definition quality content on four screens concurrently. As of December\xa031, 2017, pricing on our plans ranged in the U.S. from $7.99 to $13.99 per month and internationally from the U.S. dollar equivalent of approximately $4 to $20 per month. We expect that from time to time the prices of our membership plans in each country may increase.\n\nThe following represents the key elements to our segment results of operations:\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  |  |\n| • | We define contribution profit (loss) as revenues less cost of revenues and marketing expenses incurred by the segment. We believe this is an important measure of our operating segment performance as it represents each segment\'s performance before global corporate costs. As markets within our International streaming segment become profitable, we increasingly focus on our global operating margin as a measure of profitability. |\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  |  |\n| • | For the Domestic and International streaming segments, amortization of the streaming content assets makes up the vast majority of cost of revenues. Increasingly, we obtain multi-territory or global rights for our streaming content and allocate these rights between Domestic and International streaming segments based on estimated fair market value. Expenses associated with the acquisition, licensing and production of streaming content, streaming delivery costs and other operations costs make up the remainder of cost of revenues. We have built our own global content delivery network ("Open Connect") to help us efficiently stream a high volume of content to our members over the internet. Streaming delivery expenses, therefore, include equipment costs related to Open Connect and all third-party costs, such |\n\n19', "Table of Contents\n\nas cloud computing costs, associated with delivering streaming content over the internet.

See Note 4 Long-term Debt in the accompanying notes to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8, "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further detail of our long-term debt obligations.\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|  |  | Year Ended December\xa031, | | | | | | | | | | |  | Change | | | | | | | | | | | | |\n|  |  | 2017 | | |  | 2016 | | |  | 2015 | | |  | 2017 vs. 2016 | | | | | |  | 2016 vs. 2015 | | | | | |\n|  |  | (in thousands, except percentages) | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |\n| Interest expense |  | $ | (238,204 | ) |  | $ | (150,114 | ) |  | $ | (132,716 | ) |  | $ | 88,090 |  |  | 59 | % |  | $ | 17,398 |  |  | 13 | % |\n| As a percentage of revenues |  | 2 | | % |  | 2 | | % |  | 2 | | % |  |  | | |  |  | |  |  | | |  |  | |\n\nYear ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2016\n\nInterest expense for the year ended December\xa031, 2017 consists primarily of $229.2 million of interest on our notes. The increase in interest expense for the year ended December\xa031, 2017 as compared to the year ended December\xa031, 2016 is due to the increase of long-term debt.\n\nYear ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2015\n\nInterest expense for the year ended December\xa031, 2016 consists primarily of $143.3 million of interest on our notes. The increase in interest expense for the year ended December\xa031, 2016 as compared to the year ended December\xa031, 2015 is due to the increase of long-term debt.\n\nInterest and Other Income (Expense)\n\nInterest and other income (expense) consists primarily of foreign exchange gains and losses on foreign currency denominated balances and interest earned on cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments.\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|  |  | Year Ended December 31, | | | | | | | | | | |  | Change | | | | | | | | | | | | |\n|  |  | 2017 | | |  | 2016 | | |  | 2015 | | |  | 2017 vs. 2016 | | | | | |  | 2016 vs. 2015 | | | | | |\n|  |  | (in thousands, except percentages) | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |\n| Interest and other income (expense) |  | $ | (115,154 | ) |  | $ | 30,828 |  |  | $ | (31,225 | ) |  | $ | (145,982 | ) |  | (474 | )% |  | $ | 62,053 |  |  | 199 | % |\n\nYear ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2016\n\nInterest and other income (expense) decreased primarily due to foreign exchange losses. In the year ended December\xa031, 2017, the foreign exchange loss of $127.9 million was primarily driven by the $140.8 million loss from remeasurement of our €1,300 million Senior Notes partially offset by the remeasurement of cash and content liability positions in currencies other than functional currencies of our European and U.S. entities.\n\n24', 'Table of Contents\n\nYear ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2015\n\nInterest and other income (expense) increased primarily due to foreign exchange. In the year ended December\xa031, 2016, the foreign exchange gain of $22.8 million was primarily driven by the remeasurement of significant content liabilities denominated in currencies other than functional currencies.\n\nProvision for Income Taxes\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|  |  | Year Ended December\xa031, | | | | | | | | | | |  | Change | | | | | | | | | | | |\n|  |  | 2017 | | |  | 2016 | | |  | 2015 | | |  | 2017 vs. 2016 | | | | | |  | 2016 vs. 2015 | | | | |\n|  |  | (in thousands, except percentages) | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |\n| Provision for (benefit from) income taxes |  | $ | (73,608 | ) |  | $ | 73,829 |  |  | $ | 19,244 |  |  | $ | (147,437 | ) |  | (200 | )% |  | 54,585 |  |  | 284 | % |\n| Effective tax rate |  | (15 | | )% |  | 28 | | % |  | 14 | | % |  |  | | |  |  | |  |  | |  |  | |\n\nYear ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2016\n\nAt the beginning of 2017, we underwent a corporate restructuring that better aligns our corporate structure with how our business operates. As a result of this restructuring and our increasing international income, there is now significantly more income being taxed at rates lower than the U.S. tax rate.\n\nThe decrease in our effective tax rate is mainly due to the recognition of excess tax benefits attributable to the adoption of ASU 2016-09 and an increase in foreign income taxed at rates lower than the U.S. statutory rate. In 2017, the difference between our (15)% effective tax rate and the Federal statutory rate of 35% was $(243.5) million primarily due to the recognition of excess tax benefits as a component of the provision for income taxes, an increase in foreign income taxed at rates lower than the U.S. statutory rate and Federal and California research and development credits (“R&D”), partially offset by state taxes and non-deductible expenses as well as the provisional impact of changes to tax law.\n\nOn December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the “Act”) was signed into law making significant changes to the Internal Revenue Code. Changes include, but are not limited to, a corporate tax rate decrease from 35% to 21% effective for tax years beginning after December\xa031, 2017, the transition of U.S international taxation from a worldwide tax system to a territorial system, and a one-time transition tax on the mandatory deemed repatriation of cumulative foreign earnings as of December 31, 2017. We have calculated our best estimate of the impact of the Act in our year end income tax provision in accordance with our understanding of the Act and guidance available as of the date of this filing and as a result have recorded $79.1 million as additional income tax expense in the fourth quarter of 2017, the period in which the legislation was enacted. The provisional amount related to the remeasurement of certain deferred tax assets and liabilities, based on the rates at which they are expected to reverse in the future, was $46.9 million. The provisional amount related to the one-time transition tax on the mandatory deemed repatriation of foreign earnings was $32.2 million based on cumulative foreign earnings of $484.9 million. We also recorded a $66.5 million benefit related to foreign taxes expensed in prior years that may now be claimed as a Foreign Tax Credit. We have determined there is sufficient foreign source income projected to utilize these credits.\n\nYear ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2015\n\nThe increase in our effective tax rate is mainly due to a $13.4 million release of tax reserves in 2015 and an increase in foreign taxes. In 2016, the difference between our 28% effective tax rate and the Federal statutory rate of 35% was $17.3 million primarily due to the 2016 Federal and California R&D credits partially offset by state income taxes, foreign taxes, and nondeductible expenses.\n\n25', 'Table of Contents\n\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | | | | | | | |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|  | Year Ended December\xa031, | | | | | | |\n|  | 2017 | | |  | 2016 | | |\n|  | (in thousands) | | | | | | |\n| Cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments | $ | 2,822,795 |  |  | $ | 1,733,782 |  |\n| Long-term debt | 6,499,432 | |  |  | 3,364,311 | |  |\n\nCash, cash equivalents and short-term investments increased $1,089.0 million in the year ended December\xa031, 2017 primarily due to cash received from the issuance of debt partially offset by an increase in cash used in operations. As of December\xa031, 2017, cash and cash equivalents held by our foreign subsidiaries amounted to $611.3 million. The Tax Cut and Jobs Act of 2017 included a one-time transition tax on unremitted foreign earnings, and accordingly, we recorded tax expense of $32.2 million related to the transition tax on the one-time mandatory deemed repatriation of all our foreign earnings as of December\xa031, 2017. See Note 9 Income Taxes in the accompanying notes to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8, "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information on income taxes.\n\nLong-term debt, net of debt issuance costs, increased $3,135.1 million due to long-term note issuances of €1,300.0 million in May 2017 and $1,600.0 million in October 2017. The earliest maturity date for our outstanding long-term debt is February 2021. In July 2017, we entered into a\xa0$500.0 million\xa0unsecured revolving credit facility (“Revolving Credit Agreement”), with an uncommitted incremental facility to increase the amount of the revolving credit facility by up to an additional\xa0$250.0 million\xa0subject to certain terms and conditions. As of\xa0December\xa031, 2017, no amounts had been borrowed under the Revolving Credit Agreement. See Note 4 Long-term Debt in the accompanying notes to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8, "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information about long-term debt. We anticipate financing our capital needs in the debt market, as we believe our after-tax cost of debt is lower than our cost of equity. Our ability to obtain any additional financing that we may choose to, or need to, obtain will depend on, among other things, our development efforts, business plans, operating performance and the condition of the capital markets at the time we seek financing. We may not be able to obtain such financing on terms acceptable to us or at all. If we raise additional funds through the issuance of equity or debt securities, those securities may have rights, preferences or privileges senior to the rights of our common stock, and our stockholders may experience dilution.\n\nOur primary uses of cash include the acquisition, licensing and production of content, streaming delivery, marketing programs and personnel-related costs. For licensed content, cash payment terms have historically been in line with the amortization period. Investments in original content, and in particular content that we produce and own, require more cash upfront relative to licensed content. For example, production costs are paid as the content is created, well in advance of when the content is available on the service and amortized. We expect to significantly increase our investments in global streaming content, particularly in original content, which will impact our liquidity and result in future negative free cash flows for many years. We currently anticipate that cash flows from operations, available funds and access to financing sources, including our revolving credit facility, will continue to be sufficient to meet our cash needs for at least the next twelve months.\n\nFree Cash Flow\n\nWe define free cash flow as cash provided by (used in) operating and investing activities excluding the non-operational cash flows from purchases, maturities and sales of short-term investments. We believe free cash flow is an important liquidity metric because it measures, during a given period, the amount of cash generated that is available to repay debt obligations, make investments and for certain other activities or the amount of cash used in operations, including investments in global streaming content. Free cash flow is considered a non-GAAP financial measure and should not be considered in isolation of, or as a substitute for, net income, operating income, cash flow used in operating activities, or any other measure of financial performance or liquidity presented in accordance with GAAP.\n\nIn assessing liquidity in relation to our results of operations, we compare free cash flow to net income, noting that the three major recurring differences are excess content payments over amortization, non-cash stock-based compensation expense and other working capital differences. Working capital differences include deferred revenue, taxes and semi-annual interest payments on our outstanding debt. Our receivables from members generally settle quickly and deferred revenue is a source of cash flow.\n\n26', 'Table of Contents\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | | | | | | | | | | | |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|  | Year Ended December\xa031, | | | | | | | | | | |\n|  | 2017 | | |  | 2016 | | |  | 2015 | | |\n|  | (in thousands) | | | | | | | | | | |\n| Net cash used in operating activities | $ | (1,785,948 | ) |  | $ | (1,473,984 | ) |  | $ | (749,439 | ) |\n| Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities | 34,329 | |  |  | 49,765 | |  |  | (179,192 | | ) |\n| Net cash provided by financing activities | 3,076,990 | |  |  | 1,091,630 | |  |  | 1,640,277 | |  |\n|  |  | | |  |  | | |  |  | | |\n| Non-GAAP free cash flow reconciliation: |  | | |  |  | | |  |  | | |\n| Net cash used in operating activities | (1,785,948 | | ) |  | (1,473,984 | | ) |  | (749,439 | | ) |\n| Acquisition of DVD content assets | (53,720 | | ) |  | (77,177 | | ) |  | (77,958 | | ) |\n| Purchases of property and equipment | (173,302 | | ) |  | (107,653 | | ) |  | (91,248 | | ) |\n| Other assets | (6,689 | | ) |  | (941 | | ) |  | (1,912 | | ) |\n| Non-GAAP free cash flow | $ | (2,019,659 | ) |  | $ | (1,659,755 | ) |  | $ | (920,557 | ) |\n\nYear ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2016\n\nCash used in operating activities increased $312.0 million resulting in net cash used in operating activities of $1,785.9 million for the year ended December\xa031, 2017. The significant net cash used in operations is due primarily to the increase in investments in streaming content that require more upfront payments. The payments for streaming content assets increased $2,025.1 million, from $6,880.6 million to $8,905.8 million, or 29%, as compared to an increase in the amortization of streaming content assets of $1,409.3 million, from $4,788.5 million to $6,197.8 million, or 29%. In addition, we had increased payments associated with higher operating expenses, primarily related to increased headcount costs to support our continued improvements in our streaming service, our international expansion and increased content production activities. The increased use of cash was partially offset by a $2,862.0 million or 32% increase in revenues.\n\nCash provided by investing activities decreased by $15.4 million, primarily due to a $65.6 million increase in the purchases of property and equipment, largely due to the expansion of our Los Gatos, California headquarters, as well as our new office space in Los Angeles, California. This increase in cash used was partially offset by an increase of $32.5 million in the proceeds from sales and maturities of short-term investments, net of purchases due to the sale of our short-term investments in July 2017 as well as a decline in DVD purchases of $23.5 million.\n\nCash provided by financing activities increased $1,985.4 million primarily due to the $2,988.4 million net proceeds from the issuance of the 3.625% Notes and 4.875% Notes in the year ended December\xa031, 2017 as compared to the $989.3 million net proceeds from the issuance of the 4.375% Notes in the year ended December\xa031, 2016.\n\nFree cash flow was $2,578.6 million lower than net income for the year ended December\xa031, 2017 primarily due to $2,707.9 million of cash payments for streaming content assets over streaming amortization expense and $52.9 million of unfavorable other working capital differences partially offset by $182.2 million of non-cash stock-based compensation expense.\n\nYear ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2015\n\nCash used in operating activities increased $724.5 million resulting in net cash used in operating activities of $1,474.0 million for the year ended\xa0December\xa031, 2016. The significant net cash used in operations is due primarily to the increase in investments in streaming content that require more upfront payments. The payments for streaming content assets increased $2,271.4 million, from $4,609.2 million to $6,880.6 million, or 49%. In addition, we had increased payments associated with higher operating expenses. The increased use of cash was partially offset by a $2,051.2 million or 30% increase in revenues.\n\nCash provided by investing activities increased $229.0 million, primarily due to an increase of $243.6 million in the proceeds from sales and maturities of short-term investments, net of purchases, partially offset by a $16.4 million increase in the purchases of property and equipment, primarily driven by the expansion of our Los Gatos, California headquarters, as well as our new office space in Los Angeles, California.\n\nCash provided by financing activities decreased $548.6 million primarily due to the $1,482.4 million net proceeds from the issuance of the 5.50% Notes and the 5.875% Notes in the year ended\xa0December\xa031, 2015\xa0as compared to the $989.3 million net proceeds from the issuance of the 4.375% Notes in the year ended\xa0December\xa031, 2016.\n\n27', 'Table of Contents\n\nFree cash flow was $1,846.4 million lower than net income for the year ended\xa0December\xa031, 2016\xa0primarily due to $2,092.1 million of cash payments for streaming content assets over streaming amortization expense partially offset by $173.7 million of non-cash stock-based compensation expense and $72.0 million of favorable other working capital differences.\n\nContractual Obligations\n\nFor the purpose of this table, contractual obligations for purchases of goods or services are defined as agreements that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction.

An obligation for the production of content includes non-cancelable commitments under creative talent and employment agreements. An obligation for the acquisition and licensing of content is incurred at the time we enter into an agreement to obtain future titles. Once a title becomes available, a content liability is recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Certain agreements include the obligation to license rights for unknown future titles, the ultimate quantity and/or fees for which are not yet determinable as of the reporting date. Traditional film output deals, or certain TV series license agreements where the number of seasons to be aired is unknown, are examples of these types of agreements. The contractual obligations table above does not include any estimated obligation for the unknown future titles, payment for which could range from less than one year to more than five years. However, these unknown obligations are expected to be significant and we believe could include approximately $3 billion to $5 billion over the next three years, with the payments for the vast majority of such amounts expected to occur after the next twelve months. The foregoing range is based on considerable management judgments and the actual amounts may differ. Once we know the title that we will receive and the license fees, we include the amount in the contractual obligations table above.\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  |  |\n| (2) | Long-term debt obligations include our Notes consisting of principal and interest payments.

At this time, an estimate of the range of reasonably possible adjustments to the balance of unrecognized tax benefits cannot be made.\n\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\n\nWe do not have transactions with unconsolidated entities, such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities, whereby we have financial guarantees, subordinated retained interests, derivative instruments, or other contingent arrangements that expose us to material continuing risks, contingent liabilities, or any other obligation under a variable interest in an unconsolidated entity that provides financing, liquidity, market risk, or credit risk support to us.\n\nIndemnifications\n\nThe information set forth under Note 6 Guarantees - Indemnification Obligations in the accompanying notes to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8, "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K is incorporated herein by reference.\n\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\n\nThe preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported periods. The Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") has defined a company’s critical accounting policies as the ones that are most important to the portrayal of a company’s financial condition and results of operations, and which require a company to make its most difficult and subjective judgments. Based on this definition, we have identified the critical accounting policies and judgments addressed below. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates.\n\nStreaming Content\n\nWe acquire, license and produce content, including original programing, in order to offer our members unlimited viewing of TV shows and films. The content licenses are for a fixed fee and specific windows of availability. Payment terms for certain content licenses and the production of content require more upfront cash payments relative to the amortization expense. Payments for content, including additions to streaming assets and the changes in related liabilities, are classified within "Net cash used in operating activities" on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.\n\nFor licenses, we capitalize the fee per title and record a corresponding liability at the gross amount of the liability when the license period begins, the cost of the title is known and the title is accepted and available for streaming. The portion available for streaming within one year is recognized as “Current content assets, net” and the remaining portion as “Non-current content assets, net” on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\n\nFor productions, we capitalize costs associated with the production, including development cost, direct costs and production overhead. We include these amounts in "Non-current content assets, net" on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Participations and residuals are expensed in line with the amortization of production costs.\n\nBased on factors including historical and estimated viewing patterns, we amortize the content assets (licensed and produced) in “Cost of revenues” on the Consolidated Statements of Operations, over the shorter of each title\'s contractual window of availability or estimated period of use or ten years, beginning with the month of first availability. The amortization is on an accelerated basis as we typically expect more upfront viewing, for instance due to additional merchandising and marketing efforts. We review factors that impact the amortization of the content assets on a regular basis. Our estimates related to these factors require considerable management judgment.\n\nOur business model is subscription based as opposed to a model generating revenues at a specific title level. Therefore, content assets, both licensed and produced, are reviewed in aggregate at the operating segment level when an event or change in circumstances indicates a change in the expected usefulness. To date, we have not identified any such event or changes in circumstances. If such changes are identified in the future, these aggregated content assets will be stated at the lower of unamortized cost, net realizable value or fair value. In addition, unamortized costs for assets that have been, or are expected to be, abandoned are written off.\n\n29', 'Table of Contents\n\nIncome Taxes\n\nWe record a provision for income taxes for the anticipated tax consequences of our reported results of operations using the asset and liability method. Deferred income taxes are recognized by applying enacted statutory tax rates applicable to future years to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases as well as net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. The measurement of deferred tax assets is reduced, if necessary, by a valuation allowance for any tax benefits for which future realization is uncertain.\n\nAlthough we believe our assumptions, judgments and estimates are reasonable, changes in tax laws or our interpretation of tax laws and the resolution of any tax audits could significantly impact the amounts provided for income taxes in our consolidated financial statements.\n\nIn evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets, in full or in part, we consider all available positive and negative evidence, including our past operating results, and our forecast of future earnings, future taxable income and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies. The assumptions utilized in determining future taxable income require significant judgment and are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying businesses. Actual operating results in future years could differ from our current assumptions, judgments and estimates. However, we believe that it is more likely than not that most of the deferred tax assets recorded on our Consolidated Balance Sheets will ultimately be realized. We record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the net amount that we believe is more likely than not to be realized. At December 31, 2017 the valuation allowance of $49.4 million was related to foreign tax credits that we are not expected to realize.\n\nWe did not recognize certain tax benefits from uncertain tax positions within the provision for income taxes. We may recognize a tax benefit only if it is more likely than not the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such positions are then measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon settlement. At December\xa031, 2017, our estimated gross unrecognized tax benefits were $42.9 million of which $37.9 million, if recognized, would favorably impact our future earnings. Due to uncertainties in any tax audit outcome, our estimates of the ultimate settlement of our unrecognized tax positions may change and the actual tax benefits may differ significantly from the estimates.\n\nOn December\xa022, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the “Act”) was signed into law making significant changes to the Internal Revenue Code. Changes include, but are not limited to, a federal corporate tax rate decrease from 35% to 21% for tax years beginning after December\xa031, 2017 , the transition of U.S international taxation from a worldwide tax system to a territorial system, and a one-time transition tax on the mandatory deemed repatriation of foreign earnings. We have estimated our provision for income taxes in accordance with the Act and guidance available as of the date of this filing and as a result have recorded $79.1 million as additional income tax expense in the fourth quarter of 2017, the period in which the legislation was enacted. The provisional amount related to the remeasurement of certain deferred tax assets and liabilities, based on the rates at which they are expected to reverse in the future, was $46.9 million. The provisional amount related to the one-time transition tax on the mandatory deemed repatriation of foreign earnings was $32.2 million based on cumulative foreign earnings of $484.9 million.\n\nOn December 22, 2017, Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 ("SAB 118") was issued to address the application of US GAAP in situations when a registrant does not have the necessary information available, prepared, or analyzed (including computations) in reasonable detail to complete the accounting for certain income tax effects of the Act. In accordance with SAB 118, we have determined that the $46.9 million of the deferred tax expense recorded in connection with the remeasurement of certain deferred tax assets and liabilities and the $32.2 million of current tax expense recorded in connection with the transition tax on the mandatory deemed repatriation of foreign earnings was a provisional amount and a reasonable estimate at December 31, 2017. Additional work is necessary for a more detailed analysis of our deferred tax assets and liabilities and our historical foreign earnings as well as potential correlative adjustments. Any subsequent adjustment to these amounts will be recorded to current tax expense in the quarter of 2018 when the analysis is complete.\n\nSee Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements for further information regarding income taxes.\n\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\n\nThe information set forth under Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements under the caption “Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” is incorporated herein by reference.\n\n30', 'Table of Contents\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  |  |\n| Item 7A. | Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk |\n\nWe are exposed to market risks related to interest rate changes and the corresponding changes in the market values of our debt and foreign currency fluctuations. In July 2017, we sold all short-term investments.\n\nInterest Rate Risk\n\nAt December\xa031, 2017, our cash equivalents were generally invested in money market funds, which are not subject to market risk because the interest paid on such funds fluctuates with the prevailing interest rate.\n\nAs of December\xa031, 2017, we had $6.6 billion of debt, consisting of fixed rate unsecured debt in seven tranches due between 2021 and 2028. Refer to Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements for details about all issuances. The fair value of our debt will fluctuate with movements of interest rates, increasing in periods of declining rates of interest and declining in periods of increasing rates of interest. The fair value of our debt will also fluctuate based on changes in foreign currency rates, as discussed below.\n\nForeign Currency Risk\n\nInternational revenues and cost of revenues account for 44% and 54%, respectively, of consolidated amounts for the year ended December\xa031, 2017. The majority of international revenues and a smaller portion of expenses are denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar and we therefore have foreign currency risk related to these currencies, which are primarily the euro, the British pound, the Canadian dollar, the Australian dollar, the Japanese yen and the Brazilian real.\n\nAccordingly, changes in exchange rates, and in particular a weakening of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar may negatively affect our revenue and contribution profit (loss) of our International streaming segment as expressed in U.S. dollars. For the year ended December\xa031, 2017, we believe our international revenues would have been approximately $21.9 million lower had foreign currency exchange rates remained consistent with those for the year ended December\xa031, 2016.\n\nWe have also experienced and will continue to experience fluctuations in our net income as a result of gains (losses) on the settlement and the remeasurement of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies that are not the functional currency. In the year ended December\xa031, 2017, we recognized a $127.9 million foreign exchange loss which resulted primarily from the remeasurement of our\xa0€1,300.0\xa0million Senior Notes and was partially offset by the remeasurement of significant content liabilities denominated in currencies other than functional currencies of our European and U.S. entities.\n\nIn addition, the effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents in the year ended December\xa031, 2017 was an increase of $29.8 million.\n\nWe do not use foreign exchange contracts or derivatives to hedge any foreign currency exposures. The volatility of exchange rates depends on many factors that we cannot forecast with reliable accuracy. Our continued international expansion increases our exposure to exchange rate fluctuations and as a result such fluctuations could have a significant impact on our future results of operations.\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  |  |\n| Item 8. | Financial Statements and Supplementary Data |\n\nThe consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes listed in Part IV, Item\xa015(a)(1) of this Annual Report on Form 10-K are included immediately following Part IV hereof and incorporated by reference herein.\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  |  |\n| Item 9. | Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure |\n\nNone.\n\n31', 'Table of Contents\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  |  |\n| Item 9A. | Controls and Procedures |\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  |  |\n| (a) | Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures |\n\nOur management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K were effective in providing reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission’s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures.\n\nOur management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal controls will prevent all error and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within Netflix have been detected.\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  |  |\n| (b) | Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting |\n\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as amended (the Exchange Act)). Our management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December\xa031, 2017. In making this assessment, our management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (“COSO”) in Internal Control—Integrated Framework (2013 framework). Based on our assessment under the framework in Internal Control—Integrated Framework (2013 framework), our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December\xa031, 2017. The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December\xa031, 2017 has been audited by Ernst & Young LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report that is included herein.\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  |  |\n| (c) | Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting |\n\nThere was no change in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended December\xa031, 2017 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\n\n32', "Table of Contents\n\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\n\nThe Board of Directors and Stockholders of Netflix, Inc.\n\nOpinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\n\nWe have audited Netflix, Inc.’s internal control over financial reporting as of December\xa031, 2017, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). In our opinion, Netflix, Inc. (the Company) maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December\xa031, 2017, based on the COSO criteria.\n\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of December\xa031, 2017 and 2016, and the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, stockholders’ equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December\xa031, 2017 of the Company and our report dated January\xa029, 2018 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.\n\nBasis for Opinion\n\nThe Company's management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\n\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\n\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\n\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\n\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  | |\n|  |  |\n|  | /s/ Ernst & Young LLP |\n| San Jose, California |  |\n| January 29, 2018 |  |\n\n33", 'Table of Contents\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  |  |\n| Item 9B. | Other Information |\n\nNone.\n\n34', 'Table of Contents\n\nPART III\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  |  |\n| Item 10. | Directors, Executive Officers and Corporate Governance |\n\nInformation regarding our directors and executive officers is incorporated by reference from the information contained under the sections “Proposal One: Election of Directors,” “Section 16(a) Beneficial Ownership Compliance” and “Code of Ethics” in our Proxy Statement for the Annual Meeting of Stockholders.\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  |  |\n| Item 11. | Executive Compensation |\n\nInformation required by this item is incorporated by reference from information contained under the section “Compensation of Executive Officers and Other Matters” in our Proxy Statement for the Annual Meeting of Stockholders.\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  |  |\n| Item 12. | Security Ownership of Certain Beneficial Owners and Management and Related Stockholder Matters |\n\nInformation required by this item is incorporated by reference from information contained under the sections “Security Ownership of Certain Beneficial Owners and Management” and “Equity Compensation Plan Information” in our Proxy Statement for the Annual Meeting of Stockholders.\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  |  |\n| Item 13. | Certain Relationships and Related Transactions, and Director Independence |\n\nInformation required by this item is incorporated by reference from information contained under the section “Certain Relationships and Related Transactions” and “Director Independence” in our Proxy Statement for the Annual Meeting of Stockholders.\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  |  |\n| Item 14. | Principal Accounting Fees and Services |\n\nInformation with respect to principal independent registered public accounting firm fees and services is incorporated by reference from the information under the caption “Proposal Two: Ratification of Appointment of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm” in our Proxy Statement for the Annual Meeting of Stockholders.\n\n35', 'Table of Contents\n\nPART IV\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  |  |\n| Item 15. | Exhibits, Financial Statement Schedules |\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  |  |\n| (a) | The following documents are filed as part of this Annual Report on Form 10-K: |\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  |  |\n| (1) | Financial Statements: |\n\nThe financial statements are filed as part of this Annual Report on Form 10-K under “Item 8.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  |  |\n| 1. | Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies |\n\nDescription of Business\n\nNetflix, Inc. (the “Company”) was incorporated on August\xa029, 1997 and began operations on April\xa014, 1998. The Company is the world’s leading internet television network with over 117 million streaming memberships in over 190 countries enjoying more than 140 million hours of TV shows and movies per day, including original series, documentaries and feature films. Members can watch as much as they want, anytime, anywhere, on nearly any internet-connected screen. Members can play, pause and resume watching, all without commercials or commitments. Additionally, in the United States ("U.S."), members can receive DVDs.\n\nThe Company has three reportable segments: Domestic streaming, International streaming and Domestic DVD, all of which derive revenue from monthly membership fees. See Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements for further detail on the Company\'s segments.\n\nBasis of Presentation\n\nThe consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. Intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated.\n\nUse of Estimates\n\nThe preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Significant items subject to such estimates and assumptions include the streaming content asset amortization policy and the recognition and measurement of income tax assets and liabilities. The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that the Company believes to be reasonable under the circumstances. On an ongoing basis, the Company evaluates these assumptions, judgments and estimates. Actual results may differ from these estimates.\n\nRecently adopted accounting pronouncements\n\nIn March 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") 2016-09, Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting, which amends Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") Topic 718,\xa0Compensation – Stock Compensation. ASU 2016-09 simplifies several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment transactions, including the income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, and classification on the statement of cash flows. Under the new standard, all excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies are recorded as a component of the provision for income taxes in the reporting period in which they occur. Additionally, ASU 2016-09 requires that the Company present excess tax benefits on the Statement of Cash Flows as an operating activity.\xa0ASU 2016-09\xa0is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company adopted ASU 2016-09 in fiscal year 2017 and elected to apply this adoption prospectively. Prior periods have not been adjusted. See Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements for information regarding the impact on the Company’s financial statements.\n\nIn January 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-01,\xa0Business Combinations (Topic 805):\xa0Clarifying the Definition of a Business.\xa0The standard provides guidance to assist entities with evaluating whether transactions should be accounted for as acquisitions (or disposals) of assets or businesses. If substantially all of the fair value of the gross assets acquired (or disposed of) is concentrated in a single asset or a group of similar assets, the assets acquired (or disposed of) are not considered a business. ASU 2017-01 is effective for fiscal periods beginning after December 15, 2017 (including interim periods within those periods) with early adoption permitted. The Company early adopted the standard in the third quarter of 2017 on a prospective basis and the impact on its consolidated financial statements was not material.\n\nRecently issued accounting pronouncements not yet adopted\n\nIn May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) which amended the existing accounting standards for revenue recognition. ASU 2014-09 establishes principles for recognizing revenue upon the transfer of promised goods or services to customers, in an amount that reflects the expected consideration received in exchange for those goods or services. In July 2015, the FASB deferred the effective date for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017 (including interim reporting periods within those periods). The amendments may be applied\n\n45', 'Table of Contents\n\nretrospectively to each prior period (full retrospective) or retrospectively with the cumulative effect recognized as of the date of initial application (modified retrospective). The Company will adopt ASU 2014-09 in the first quarter of 2018 and apply the modified retrospective approach. Because the Company\'s primary source of revenues is from monthly membership fees which are recognized ratably over each monthly membership period, the Company does not expect the impact on its consolidated financial statements to be material.\n\nIn February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842) in order to increase transparency and comparability among organizations by recognizing lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet for those leases classified as operating leases under previous GAAP. ASU 2016-02 requires that a lessee should recognize a liability to make lease payments (the lease liability) and a right-of-use asset representing its right to use the underlying asset for the lease term on the balance sheet. ASU 2016-02 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018 (including interim periods within those periods) using a modified retrospective approach and early adoption is permitted. The Company will adopt ASU 2016-02 in the first quarter of 2019. Although the Company is in the process of evaluating the impact of adoption of the ASU on its consolidated financial statements, the Company currently believes the most significant changes will be related to the recognition of new right-of-use assets and lease liabilities on the Company\'s balance sheet for real estate operating leases.\n\nIn November 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-18, Restricted Cash, which requires amounts generally described as restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents be included with cash and cash equivalents when reconciling the total beginning and ending amounts for the periods shown on the statement of cash flows. ASU 2016-08 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017 (including interim periods within those periods) using a retrospective transition method to each period presented. The Company will adopt ASU 2016-18 in the first quarter of 2018 and does not expect the impact on its consolidated financial statements to be material.\n\nIn January 2018, the FASB released guidance on the accounting for tax on the global intangible low-taxed income ("GILTI") provisions of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the "Act"). The GILTI provisions impose a tax on foreign income in excess of a deemed return on tangible assets of foreign corporations. The guidance indicates that either accounting\xa0for deferred taxes related to GILTI inclusions or to treat any taxes on GILTI inclusions as period cost are both acceptable methods subject to an accounting policy election. Effective the first quarter of 2018, the Company will elect to treat any potential GILTI inclusions as a period cost as we are not projecting any material impact from GILTI inclusions and any deferred taxes related to any inclusion would be immaterial.\n\nCash Equivalents and Short-term Investments\n\nThe Company considers investments in instruments purchased with an original maturity of 90 days or less to be cash equivalents. The Company also classifies amounts in transit from payment processors for customer credit card and debit card transactions as cash equivalents.\n\nIn July 2017, the Company sold all short-term investments. The Company classified short-term investments, which consisted of marketable securities with original maturities in excess of 90 days as available-for-sale. Short-term investments were reported at fair value with unrealized gains and losses included in “Accumulated other comprehensive loss” within Stockholders’ equity in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The amortization of premiums and discounts on the investments, realized gains and losses, and declines in value judged to be other-than-temporary on available-for-sale securities are included in “Interest and other income (expense)” in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The Company used the specific identification method to determine cost in calculating realized gains and losses upon the sale of short-term investments.\n\nShort-term investments were reviewed periodically to identify possible other-than-temporary impairment. When evaluating the investments, the Company reviewed factors such as the length of time and extent to which fair value has been below cost basis, the financial condition of the issuer, the Company’s intent to sell, or whether it would be more likely than not that the Company would be required to sell the investments before the recovery of their amortized cost basis.\n\nStreaming Content\n\nThe Company acquires, licenses and produces content, including original programming, in order to offer members unlimited viewing of TV shows and films. The content licenses are for a fixed fee and specific windows of availability. Payment terms for certain content licenses and the production of content require more upfront cash payments relative to the amortization expense. Payments for content, including additions to streaming assets and the changes in related liabilities, are classified within "Net cash used in operating activities" on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.\n\nFor licenses, the Company capitalizes the fee per title and records a corresponding liability at the gross amount of the liability when the license period begins, the cost of the title is known and the title is accepted and available for streaming. The portion available for streaming within one year is recognized as “Current content assets, net” and the remaining portion as “Non-current content assets, net” on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\n\n46', 'Table of Contents\n\nFor productions, the Company capitalizes costs associated with the production, including development costs, direct costs and production overhead. These amounts are included in "Non-current content assets, net" on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Participations and residuals are expensed in line with the amortization of production costs.\n\nBased on factors including historical and estimated viewing patterns, the Company amortizes the content assets (licensed and produced) in “Cost of revenues” on the Consolidated Statements of Operations over the shorter of each title\'s contractual window of availability or estimated period of use or 10 years, beginning with the month of first availability. The amortization is on an accelerated basis, as the Company typically expects more upfront viewing, for instance due to additional merchandising and marketing efforts. The Company reviews factors impacting the amortization of the content assets on an ongoing basis. The Company\'s estimates related to these factors require considerable management judgment.\n\nThe Company\'s business model is subscription based as opposed to a model generating revenues at a specific title level. Therefore, content assets, both licensed and produced, are reviewed in aggregate at the operating segment level when an event or change in circumstances indicates a change in the expected usefulness of the content or that the net realizable value or fair value may be less than amortized cost. To date, the Company has not identified any such event or changes in circumstances. If such changes are identified in the future, these aggregated content assets will be stated at the lower of unamortized cost, net realizable value or fair value. In addition, unamortized costs for assets that have been, or are expected to be, abandoned are written off.\n\nProperty and Equipment\n\nProperty and equipment are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method over the shorter of the estimated useful lives of the respective assets, generally up to 30 years, or the lease term for leasehold improvements, if applicable. Leased buildings are capitalized and included in property and equipment when the Company was involved in the construction funding and did not meet the “sale-leaseback” criteria.\n\nRevenue Recognition\n\nThe Company\'s primary source of revenues are from monthly membership fees. Members are billed in advance of the start of their monthly membership and revenues are recognized ratably over each monthly membership period. Revenues are presented net of the taxes that are collected from members and remitted to governmental authorities. Deferred revenue consists of membership fees billed that have not been recognized and gift and other prepaid memberships that have not been redeemed.\n\nMarketing\n\nMarketing expenses consist primarily of advertising expenses and certain payments made to the Company’s partners, including consumer electronics (“CE”) manufacturers, multichannel video programming distributors (“MVPDs”), mobile operators and internet service providers (“ISPs”). Advertising expenses include promotional activities such as digital and television advertising. Advertising costs are expensed as incurred. Advertising expenses were $1,091.1 million, $842.4 million and $714.3 million for the years ended December\xa031, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.\n\nResearch and Development\n\nResearch and development expenses are included within "Technology and Development" on the Company\'s Consolidated Statements of Operations and primarily consist of payroll and related costs incurred in making improvements to our service offerings. Research and development expenses were $981.3 million, $768.3 million and $570.0 million for the years ended December\xa031, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.\n\nIncome Taxes\n\nThe Company records a provision for income taxes for the anticipated tax consequences of the reported results of operations using the asset and liability method. Deferred income taxes are recognized by applying enacted statutory tax rates applicable to future years to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases as well as net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. The measurement of deferred tax assets is reduced, if necessary, by a valuation allowance for any tax benefits for which future realization is uncertain.\n\nThe Company did not recognize certain tax benefits from uncertain tax positions within the provision for income taxes. The Company may recognize a tax benefit only if it is more likely than not the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such positions are then measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon\n\n47', 'Table of Contents\n\nsettlement. The Company recognizes interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions in income tax expense. See Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements for further information regarding income taxes.\n\nForeign Currency\n\nThe functional currency for the Company\'s subsidiaries is determined based on the primary economic environment in which the subsidiary operates. The Company translates the assets and liabilities of its non-U.S. dollar functional currency subsidiaries into U.S. dollars using exchange rates in effect at the end of each period. Revenues and expenses for these subsidiaries are translated using rates that approximate those in effect during the period. Gains and losses from these translations are recognized in cumulative translation adjustment included in "Accumulated other comprehensive loss" in Stockholders’ equity on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\n\nPrior to January 1, 2015, the functional currency of certain of the Company\'s European entities was the British pound. The Company changed the functional currency of these entities to the euro effective January 1, 2015 following the redomiciliation of the European headquarters and the launch of the Netflix service in several significant European countries. The change in functional currency was applied prospectively from January 1, 2015. Monetary assets and liabilities have been remeasured to the euro at current exchange rates. Non-monetary assets and liabilities have been remeasured to the euro using the exchange rate effective for the period in which the balance arose. As a result of this change of functional currency, the Company recorded a $21.8 million cumulative translation adjustment included in other comprehensive loss for year ended December\xa031, 2015.\n\nThe Company remeasures monetary assets and liabilities that are not denominated in the functional currency at exchange rates in effect at the end of each period. Gains and losses from these remeasurements are recognized in interest and other income (expense). Foreign currency transactions resulted in a loss of $127.9 million for the year ended December\xa031, 2017 and a gain of $22.8 million and a loss of $37.3 million for the years ended December\xa031, 2016 and 2015 respectively.\n\nEarnings Per Share\n\nIn June 2015, the Company\'s Board of Directors declared a seven-for-one stock split in the form of a stock dividend that was paid on\xa0July 14, 2015\xa0to all shareholders of record as of\xa0July 2, 2015 ("Stock Split"). Outstanding share and per-share amounts disclosed for all periods provided have been retroactively adjusted to reflect the effects of the Stock Split.\n\nBasic earnings per share is computed using the weighted-average number of outstanding shares of common stock during the period. Diluted earnings per share is computed using the weighted-average number of outstanding shares of common stock and, when dilutive, potential common shares outstanding during the period. Potential common shares consist of incremental shares issuable upon the assumed exercise of stock options. The computation of earnings per share is as follows:\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | | | | | | | | | | | |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|  | Year ended December\xa031, | | | | | | | | | | |\n|  | 2017 | | |  | 2016 | | |  | 2015 | | |\n|  | (in\xa0thousands,\xa0except\xa0per\xa0share\xa0data) | | | | | | | | | | |\n| Basic earnings per share: |  | | |  |  | | |  |  | | |\n| Net income | $ | 558,929 |  |  | $ | 186,678 |  |  | $ | 122,641 |  |\n| Shares used in computation: |  | | |  |  | | |  |  | | |\n| Weighted-average common shares outstanding | 431,885 | |  |  | 428,822 | |  |  | 425,889 | |  |\n| Basic earnings per share | $ | 1.29 |  |  | $ | 0.44 |  |  | $ | 0.29 |  |\n| Diluted earnings per share: |  | | |  |  | | |  |  | | |\n| Net income | $ | 558,929 |  |  | $ | 186,678 |  |  | $ | 122,641 |  |\n| Shares used in computation: |  | | |  |  | | |  |  | | |\n| Weighted-average common shares outstanding | 431,885 | |  |  | 428,822 | |  |  | 425,889 | |  |\n| Employee stock options | 14,929 | |  |  | 9,830 | |  |  | 10,567 | |  |\n| Weighted-average number of shares | 446,814 | |  |  | 438,652 | |  |  | 436,456 | |  |\n| Diluted earnings per share | $ | 1.25 |  |  | $ | 0.43 |  |  | $ | 0.28 |  |\n\nEmployee stock options with exercise prices greater than the average market price of the common stock were excluded from the diluted calculation as their inclusion would have been anti-dilutive.

The hierarchy level assigned to each security in the Company’s available-for-sale portfolio and cash equivalents is based on its assessment of the transparency and reliability of the inputs used in the valuation of such instrument at the measurement date. The fair value of available-for-sale securities and cash equivalents included in the Level 1 category is based on quoted prices that are readily and regularly available in an active market. The fair value of available-for-sale securities included in the Level 2 category is based on observable inputs, such as quoted prices for similar assets at the measurement date; quoted prices in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable, either directly or indirectly. These values were obtained from an independent pricing service and were evaluated using pricing models that vary by asset class and may incorporate available trade, bid and other market information and price quotes from well-established independent pricing vendors and broker-dealers. The Company’s procedures include controls to ensure that appropriate fair values are recorded, such as comparing prices obtained from multiple independent sources. See Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements for further information regarding the fair value of the Company’s senior notes.\n\nThere were no material other-than-temporary impairments or credit losses related to available-for-sale securities in the years ended December\xa031, 2017, 2016 or 2015.\n\n49", 'Table of Contents\n\nThere were no material gross realized gains or losses from the sale of available-for-sale investments in the years ended December\xa031, 2017, 2016 and 2015.

As of December\xa031, 2017 and December\xa031, 2016, the Company was in compliance with all related covenants.\n\nRevolving Credit\xa0Facility\n\nIn July 2017, the Company entered into a\xa0$500.0 million\xa0unsecured revolving credit\xa0facility (“Revolving Credit Agreement”), with an uncommitted incremental facility to increase the amount of the revolving credit facility by up to an additional\xa0$250.0 million, subject to certain terms and conditions. Revolving loans may be borrowed, repaid and reborrowed until July 27, 2022, at which time all amounts borrowed must be repaid. The Company may use the proceeds of future borrowings under the Revolving Credit Agreement for working capital and general corporate purposes. As of\xa0December\xa031, 2017, no amounts have been borrowed under the Revolving Credit Agreement.\n\nThe borrowings under the Revolving Credit Agreement bear interest, at the Company’s option, of either a floating rate equal to a base rate (the “Alternate Base Rate”) or (ii) a rate equal to an adjusted London interbank offered rate (the “Adjusted LIBO Rate”), plus a margin of\xa00.75%. The Alternate Base Rate is defined as the greatest of (A) the rate of interest published by the Wall Street Journal, from time to time, as the prime rate, (B) the federal funds rate, plus\xa00.500%\xa0and (C) the Adjusted LIBO Rate for a one-month interest period, plus\xa01.00%. The Adjusted LIBO Rate is defined as the London interbank offered rate for deposits in U.S. dollars, for the relevant interest period, adjusted for statutory reserve requirements, but in no event shall the Adjusted LIBO Rate be less than\xa00.00%\xa0per annum.\n\nThe Company is also obligated to pay a commitment fee on the undrawn amounts of the Revolving Credit Agreement at a rate of\xa00.10%. The Revolving Credit Agreement requires the Company to comply with certain covenants, including covenants that limit or restrict the ability of the Company’s subsidiaries to incur debt and limit or restrict the ability of the Company and its subsidiaries to grant liens and enter into sale and leaseback transactions; and, in the case of the Company or a guarantor, merge, consolidate, liquidate, dissolve or sell, transfer, lease or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of the assets of the\n\n51', 'Table of Contents\n\nCompany and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole.

Obligations that are in non-U.S. dollar currencies are translated to U.S. dollar at period end rates. An obligation for the production of content includes non-cancelable commitments under creative talent and employment agreements. An obligation for the acquisition and licensing of content is incurred at the time the Company enters into an agreement to obtain future titles. Once a title becomes available, a content liability is generally recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Certain agreements include the obligation to license rights for unknown future titles, the ultimate quantity and/or fees for which are not yet determinable as of the reporting date. Traditional film output deals, or certain TV series license agreements where the number of seasons to be aired is unknown, are examples of such license agreements. The Company does not include any estimated obligation for these future titles beyond the known minimum amount. However, the unknown obligations are expected to be significant.\n\nLease obligations\n\nThe Company leases facilities under non-cancelable operating leases with various expiration dates through 2027. Several lease agreements contain rent escalation clauses or rent holidays. For purposes of recognizing minimum rental expenses on a straight-line basis over the terms of the leases, the Company uses the date of initial possession to begin amortization, which is generally when the Company enters the space and begins to make improvements in preparation for intended use. For scheduled rent escalation clauses during the lease terms or for rental payments commencing at a date other than the date of initial occupancy, the Company records minimum rental expenses on a straight-line basis over the terms of the leases in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The Company has the option to extend or renew most of its leases which may increase the future minimum lease commitments.\n\nBecause the terms of the Company’s facilities lease agreements for its original Los Gatos, California headquarters site required the Company’s involvement in the construction funding of the buildings, the Company is the “deemed owner” (for accounting purposes only) of these buildings. Accordingly, the Company recorded an asset of $40.7 million, representing the total costs of the buildings and improvements, including the costs paid by the lessor (the legal owner of the buildings), with corresponding liabilities. Upon completion of construction of each building, the Company did not meet the sale-leaseback criteria for de-recognition of the building assets and liabilities. Therefore the leases are accounted for as financing obligations. At December\xa031, 2017, the lease financing obligation balance was $29.5 million, the majority of which is recorded in “Other non-current liabilities,” on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The remaining future minimum payments under the lease financing obligation are $15.6 million. The lease financing obligation balance at the end of the lease term will be approximately $21.8 million which approximates the net book value of the buildings to be relinquished to the lessor.\n\n52', "Table of Contents\n\nIn addition to the lease financing obligation, future minimum lease payments include $508.3 million as of December\xa031, 2017 related to non-cancelable operating leases for the expanded headquarters in Los Gatos, California and the new office space in Los Angeles, California.\n\nFuture minimum payments under lease financing obligations and non-cancelable operating leases as of December\xa031, 2017 are as follows:\n\n|  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | | | |\n|  |  |  |  |\n| Year Ending December\xa031, | Future  Minimum  Payments | | |\n|  | (in\xa0thousands) | | |\n| 2018 | $ | 101,987 |  |\n| 2019 | 97,560 | |  |\n| 2020 | 96,255 | |  |\n| 2021 | 85,188 | |  |\n| 2022 | 77,418 | |  |\n| Thereafter | 278,970 | |  |\n| Total minimum payments | $ | 737,378 |  |\n\nRent expense associated with the operating leases was $75.3 million, $53.1 million and $34.7 million for the years ended December\xa031, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.\n\nLegal Proceedings\n\nFrom time to time, in the normal course of its operations, the Company is subject to litigation matters and claims, including claims relating to employee relations, business practices and patent infringement. Litigation can be expensive and disruptive to normal business operations. Moreover, the results of complex legal proceedings are difficult to predict and the Company's view of these matters may change in the future as the litigation and events related thereto unfold. The Company expenses legal fees as incurred. The Company records a provision for contingent losses when it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. An unfavorable outcome to any legal matter, if material, could have an adverse effect on the Company's operations or its financial position, liquidity or results of operations.\n\nThe Company is involved in litigation matters not listed herein but does not consider the matters to be material either individually or in the aggregate at this time. The Company's view of the matters not listed may change in the future as the litigation and events related thereto unfold.\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  |  |\n| 6. | Guarantees—Indemnification Obligations |\n\nIn the ordinary course of business, the Company has entered into contractual arrangements under which it has agreed to provide indemnification of varying scope and terms to business partners and other parties with respect to certain matters, including, but not limited to, losses arising out of the Company’s breach of such agreements and out of intellectual property infringement claims made by third parties. In these circumstances, payment may be conditional on the other party making a claim pursuant to the procedures specified in the particular contract.\n\nThe Company’s obligations under these agreements may be limited in terms of time or amount, and in some instances, the Company may have recourse against third parties for certain payments. In addition, the Company has entered into indemnification agreements with its directors and certain of its officers that will require it, among other things, to indemnify them against certain liabilities that may arise by reason of their status or service as directors or officers. The terms of such obligations vary.\n\nIt is not possible to make a reasonable estimate of the maximum potential amount of future payments under these or similar agreements due to the conditional nature of the Company’s obligations and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular agreement. No amount has been accrued in the accompanying financial statements with respect to these indemnification guarantees.\n\n53", "Table of Contents\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  |  |\n| 7. | Stockholders’ Equity |\n\nStock Split\n\nIn March 2015, the Company's Board of Directors adopted an amendment to the Company's Certificate of Incorporation, to increase the number of shares of capital stock the Company is authorized to issue from 170,000,000 (160,000,000 shares of common stock and 10,000,000 shares of preferred stock), par value $0.001 to 5,000,000,000 (4,990,000,000 shares of common stock and 10,000,000 shares of preferred stock), par value $0.001. This amendment to the Company's certificate of incorporation was approved by the Company's stockholders at the 2015 Annual Meeting held on June 9, 2015.\n\nOn June 23, 2015, the Company's Board of Directors\xa0declared a seven-for-one stock split in the form of a stock dividend that was paid on\xa0July 14, 2015\xa0to all shareholders of record as of\xa0July 2, 2015. Outstanding share and per-share amounts disclosed for all periods presented have been retroactively adjusted to reflect the effects of the Stock Split.\n\nPreferred Stock\n\nThe Company has authorized 10,000,000 shares of undesignated preferred stock with a par value of $0.001 per share. None of the preferred shares were issued and outstanding at December\xa031, 2017 and 2016.\n\nVoting Rights\n\nThe holders of each share of common stock shall be entitled to one vote per share on all matters to be voted upon by the Company’s stockholders.\n\nStock Option Plans\n\nIn June 2011, the Company adopted the 2011 Stock Plan. The 2011 Stock Plan provides for the grant of incentive stock options to employees and for the grant of non-statutory stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock and restricted stock units to employees, directors and consultants. As of December\xa031, 2017, 10.7 million shares were reserved for future grants under the 2011 Stock Plan.\n\nA summary of the activities related to the Company’s stock option plans, as adjusted for the Stock Split, is as follows:\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|  | Shares\xa0Available  for Grant | |  | Options Outstanding | | | | | |  | Weighted- Average Remaining Contractual Term (in\xa0Years) |  | Aggregate  Intrinsic\xa0Value  (in\xa0Thousands) | | |\n|  | Number of  Shares | |  | Weighted- Average Exercise Price  (per Share) | | |  |\n| Balances as of December 31, 2014 | 20,025,208 |  |  | 22,845,417 |  |  | $ | 21.65 |  |  |  |  |  | | |\n| Granted | (3,179,892 | ) |  | 3,179,892 |  |  | 82.67 | |  |  |  |  |  | | |\n| Exercised | — |  |  | (5,029,553 | ) |  | 15.38 | |  |  |  |  |  | | |\n| Balances as of December 31, 2015 | 16,845,316 |  |  | 20,995,756 |  |  | $ | 32.39 |  |  |  |  |  | | |\n| Granted | (3,555,363 | ) |  | 3,555,363 |  |  | 102.03 | |  |  |  |  |  | | |\n| Exercised | — |  |  | (2,113,772 | ) |  | 17.48 | |  |  |  |  |  | | |\n| Balances as of December 31, 2016 | 13,289,953 |  |  | 22,437,347 |  |  | $ | 44.83 |  |  |  |  |  | | |\n| Granted | (2,550,038 | ) |  | 2,550,038 |  |  | 159.56 | |  |  |  |  |  | | |\n| Exercised | — |  |  | (3,338,474 | ) |  | 26.79 | |  |  |  |  |  | | |\n| Expired | — |  |  | (1,561 | ) |  | 3.25 | |  |  |  |  |  | | |\n| Balances as of December 31, 2017 | 10,739,915 |  |  | 21,647,350 |  |  | $ | 61.13 |  |  | 5.97 |  | $ | 2,833,198 |  |\n| Vested and exercisable at  December\xa031, 2017 |  | |  | 21,647,350 |  |  | $ | 61.13 |  |  | 5.97 |  | $ | 2,833,198 |  |\n\nThe aggregate intrinsic value in the table above represents the total pretax intrinsic value (the difference between the Company’s closing stock price on the last trading day of 2017 and the exercise price, multiplied by the number of in-the-money options) that would have been received by the option holders had all option holders exercised their options on the last trading day of 2017. This amount changes based on the fair market value of the Company’s common stock. Total intrinsic value of options exercised for the years ended December\xa031, 2017, 2016 and 2015 was $464.0 million, $189.2 million and $368.4 million, respectively.\n\n54", 'Table of Contents\n\nCash received from option exercises for the years ended December\xa031, 2017, 2016 and 2015 was $88.4 million, $37.0 million and $78.0 million, respectively.\n\nStock-Based Compensation\n\nStock options granted are exercisable for the full ten year contractual term regardless of employment status.

The Company believes that implied volatility of publicly traded options in its common stock is more reflective of market conditions, and given consistently high trade volumes of the options, can reasonably be expected to be a better indicator of expected volatility than historical volatility of its common stock.\n\nIn valuing shares issued under the Company’s employee stock option plans, the Company bases the risk-free interest rate on U.S. Treasury zero-coupon issues with terms similar to the contractual term of the options. The Company does not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future and therefore uses an expected dividend yield of\xa0zero\xa0in the option valuation model. The Company does not use a post-vesting termination rate as options are fully vested upon grant date.\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  |  |\n| 8. | Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss |\n\nThe following table summarizes the changes in accumulated balances of other comprehensive loss, net of tax:\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | | | | | | | | | | | |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|  | Foreign currency | | |  | Change in unrealized gains on available-for-sale securities | | |  | Total | | |\n|  | (in thousands) | | | | | | | | | | |\n| Balances as of December 31, 2015 | $ | (42,502 | ) |  | $ | (806 | ) |  | $ | (43,308 | ) |\n| Other comprehensive income (loss) before reclassifications | (5,464 | | ) |  | 310 | |  |  | (5,154 | | ) |\n| Amounts reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive (loss) income | — | |  |  | (103 | | ) |  | (103 | | ) |\n| Net (increase) decrease in other comprehensive loss | (5,464 | | ) |  | 207 | |  |  | (5,257 | | ) |\n| Balances as of December 31, 2016 | $ | (47,966 | ) |  | $ | (599 | ) |  | $ | (48,565 | ) |\n| Other comprehensive income before reclassifications | 27,409 | |  |  | 728 | |  |  | 28,137 | |  |\n| Amounts reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive (loss) income | — | |  |  | (129 | | ) |  | (129 | | ) |\n| Net decrease in other comprehensive loss | 27,409 | |  |  | 599 | |  |  | 28,008 | |  |\n| Balances as of December 31, 2017 | $ | (20,557 | ) |  | $ | — |  |  | $ | (20,557 | ) |\n\n55', 'Table of Contents\n\nThe amounts reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive loss were immaterial for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016.\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  |  |\n| 9. | Income Taxes |\n\nIncome before provision for income taxes was as follows:\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | | | | | | | | | | | |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|  | Year Ended December\xa031, | | | | | | | | | | |\n|  | 2017 | | |  | 2016 | | |  | 2015 | | |\n|  | (in thousands) | | | | | | | | | | |\n| United States | $ | 144,100 |  |  | $ | 188,078 |  |  | $ | 95,644 |  |\n| Foreign | 341,221 | |  |  | 72,429 | |  |  | 46,241 | |  |\n| Income before income taxes | $ | 485,321 |  |  | $ | 260,507 |  |  | $ | 141,885 |  |\n\nThe components of provision for income taxes for all periods presented were as follows:\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | | | | | | | | | | | |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|  | Year Ended December\xa031, | | | | | | | | | | |\n|  | 2017 | | |  | 2016 | | |  | 2015 | | |\n|  | (in thousands) | | | | | | | | | | |\n| Current tax provision: |  | | |  |  | | |  |  | | |\n| Federal | $ | 54,245 |  |  | $ | 54,315 |  |  | $ | 52,557 |  |\n| State | (7,601 | | ) |  | 5,790 | |  |  | (1,576 | | ) |\n| Foreign | 88,436 | |  |  | 60,571 | |  |  | 26,918 | |  |\n| Total current | 135,080 | |  |  | 120,676 | |  |  | 77,899 | |  |\n| Deferred tax provision: |  | | |  |  | | |  |  | | |\n| Federal | (153,963 | | ) |  | (24,383 | | ) |  | (37,669 | | ) |\n| State | (52,695 | | ) |  | (14,080 | | ) |  | (17,635 | | ) |\n| Foreign | (2,030 | | ) |  | (8,384 | | ) |  | (3,351 | | ) |\n| Total deferred | (208,688 | | ) |  | (46,847 | | ) |  | (58,655 | | ) |\n| Provision for income taxes | $ | (73,608 | ) |  | $ | 73,829 |  |  | $ | 19,244 |  |\n\nAt the beginning of 2017, the Company underwent a corporate restructuring that better aligns its corporate structure with how its business operates. As a result of this restructuring and the Company\'s increasing international income, there is now significantly more income being taxed at rates lower than the U.S. tax rate.\n\nOn December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the “Act”) was signed into law making significant changes to the Internal Revenue Code. Changes include, but are not limited to, a corporate tax rate decrease from 35% to 21% effective for tax years beginning after December 31, 2017, the transition of U.S international taxation from a worldwide tax system to a territorial system, and a one-time transition tax on the mandatory deemed repatriation of cumulative foreign earnings as of December 31, 2017. The Company has calculated its best estimate of the impact of the Act in its year end income tax provision in accordance with its understanding of the Act and guidance available as of the date of this filing and as a result has recorded $79.1 million as an additional income tax expense in the fourth quarter of 2017, the period in which the legislation was enacted. The provisional amount related to the remeasurement of certain deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the rates at which they are expected to reverse in the future was $46.9 million. The provisional amount related to the one-time transition tax on the mandatory deemed repatriation of foreign earnings was $32.2 million based on cumulative foreign earnings of $484.9 million.\n\nOn December 22, 2017, Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 ("SAB 118") was issued to address the application of US GAAP in situations when a registrant does not have the necessary information available, prepared, or analyzed (including computations) in reasonable detail to complete the accounting for certain income tax effects of the Act. In accordance with SAB 118, the Company has determined that the $46.9 million of the deferred tax expense recorded in connection with the remeasurement of certain deferred tax assets and liabilities and the $32.2 million of current tax expense recorded in connection with the transition tax on the mandatory deemed repatriation of foreign earnings was a provisional amount and a reasonable estimate at December 31, 2017. Additional work is necessary to do a more detailed analysis of historical foreign earnings as\n\n56', 'Table of Contents\n\nwell as potential correlative adjustments. Any subsequent adjustment to these amounts will be recorded to current tax expense in the quarter of 2018 when the analysis is complete.\n\nThe Company recorded a $66.5 million benefit related to foreign taxes expensed in prior years that may now be claimed as a Foreign Tax Credit. The Company has determined there is sufficient foreign source income projected to utilize these credits.\n\nDue to the adoption of ASU 2016-09 in 2017, all excess tax benefits and deficiencies are recognized as income tax expense in the Company’s Consolidated Statement of Operations. This will result in increased volatility in the Company’s effective tax rate.\n\nA reconciliation of the provision for income taxes, with the amount computed by applying the statutory Federal income tax rate to income before income taxes is as follows:\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | | | | | | | | | | | |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|  | Year Ended December\xa031, | | | | | | | | | | |\n|  | 2017 | | |  | 2016 | | |  | 2015 | | |\n|  | (in thousands) | | | | | | | | | | |\n| Expected tax expense at U.S. Federal statutory rate of 35% | $ | 169,860 |  |  | $ | 91,179 |  |  | $ | 49,658 |  |\n| State income taxes, net of Federal income tax effect | 6,404 | |  |  | 7,261 | |  |  | 4,783 | |  |\n| Foreign earnings at other than U.S. rates | (87,514 | | ) |  | 14,639 | |  |  | 5,310 | |  |\n| Federal and California R&D tax credits | (79,868 | | ) |  | (41,144 | | ) |  | (29,363 | | ) |\n| Excess tax benefits on stock-based compensation | (157,888 | | ) |  | — | |  |  | — | |  |\n| Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 | 79,077 | |  |  | — | |  |  | — | |  |\n| Release of tax reserves on previously unrecognized tax benefits | — | |  |  | — | |  |  | (13,438 | | ) |\n| Other | (3,679 | | ) |  | 1,894 | |  |  | 2,294 | |  |\n| Provision for income taxes | $ | (73,608 | ) |  | $ | 73,829 |  |  | $ | 19,244 |  |\n| Effective Tax Rate | (15 | | )% |  | 28 | | % |  | 14 | | % |\n\nThe components of deferred tax assets and liabilities were as follows:\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | | | | | | | |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|  | As of\xa0December\xa031, | | | | | | |\n|  | 2017 | | |  | 2016 | | |\n|  | (in thousands) | | | | | | |\n| Deferred tax assets: |  | | |  |  | | |\n| Stock-based compensation | $ | 149,367 |  |  | $ | 188,458 |  |\n| Accruals and reserves | 34,170 | |  |  | 29,231 | |  |\n| Depreciation and amortization | (70,382 | | ) |  | (93,760 | | ) |\n| Federal and California tax R&D credits | 260,686 | |  |  | 107,283 | |  |\n| Federal foreign tax credits | 102,242 | |  |  | — | |  |\n| Other | 51,614 | |  |  | (2,363 | | ) |\n| Gross deferred tax assets | 527,697 | |  |  | 228,849 | |  |\n| Valuation allowance | (49,431 | | ) |  | (1,601 | | ) |\n| Net deferred tax assets | $ | 478,266 |  |  | $ | 227,248 |  |\n\nAll deferred tax assets are classified as “Other non-current assets” on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December\xa031, 2017 and December\xa031, 2016.

As of December 31, 2017, the valuation allowance of $49.4 million related to certain foreign tax credits that are not likely to be realized. The Company remeasured these non-current assets and liabilities at the applicable tax rate of 21% in accordance with the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. The remeasurement resulted in a total decrease in these assets of $46.9 million.\n\n57', 'Table of Contents\n\nAs of December\xa031, 2017, the Company\'s Federal R&D tax credit and state tax credit carryforwards for tax return purposes were $133.4 million, and $119.2 million, respectively. The Federal R&D tax credit carryforwards expire through 2037. State tax credit carryforwards can be carried forward indefinitely.\n\nAs of December 31, 2017, the Company\'s Federal foreign tax credit carryforwards for tax return purposes were $102.2 million. The Federal foreign tax credit carryovers expire through 2026.\n\nAs of December\xa031, 2017, the Company’s net operating loss carryforwards for state tax return purposes was $80.9 million which expire in 2035. As a result of the adoption of ASU 2016-09 in fiscal 2017, the Company recorded a cumulative effect adjustment to increase retained earnings by\xa0$43.6 million\xa0with a corresponding increase to deferred tax assets from stock-based compensation which had not been previously recognized.\n\nThe unrecognized tax benefits that are not expected to result in payment or receipt of cash within one year are classified as “Other non-current liabilities” and a reduction of deferred tax assets which is classified as "Other non-current assets" in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of December\xa031, 2017, the total amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits was $42.9 million, of which $37.9 million, if recognized, would favorably impact the Company’s effective tax rate.

Interest and penalties included in the Company\'s provision for income taxes were not material in all the periods presented.\n\nThe Company files U.S. Federal, state and foreign tax returns. The Company is currently under examination by the IRS and the state of California for the years 2014 and 2015. The 2016 Federal tax return remains subject to examination by the IRS. The years 2010 through 2013 and 2016 remain subject to examination by the state of California. The Company has no significant foreign jurisdiction audits underway. The years 2012 through 2016 remain subject to examination by foreign jurisdictions.\n\nGiven the potential outcome of the current examinations as well as the impact of the current examinations on the potential expiration of the statute of limitations, it is reasonably possible that the balance of unrecognized tax benefits could significantly change within the next twelve months. However, an estimate of the range of reasonably possible adjustments cannot be made.\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  |  |\n| 10. | Employee Benefit Plan |\n\nThe Company maintains a 401(k) savings plan covering substantially all of its employees. Eligible employees may contribute up to 60% of their annual salary through payroll deductions, but not more than the statutory limits set by the Internal Revenue Service. The Company matches employee contributions at the discretion of the Board. During 2017, 2016 and 2015, the Company’s matching contributions totaled $20.2 million, $15.7 million and $11.2 million, respectively.\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  |  |\n| 11. | Segment Information |\n\nThe Company has three reportable segments: Domestic streaming, International streaming and Domestic DVD.

The Company’s CODM reviews revenue and contribution\n\n58', "Table of Contents\n\nprofit (loss) for each of the reportable segments. Contribution profit (loss) is defined as revenues less cost of revenues and marketing expenses incurred by the segment. The Company has aggregated the results of the International operating segments into one reportable segment because these operating segments share similar long-term economic and other qualitative characteristics.\n\nThe Domestic streaming segment derives revenues from monthly membership fees for services consisting solely of streaming content to the members in the United States. The International streaming segment derives revenues from monthly membership fees for services consisting solely of streaming content to members outside of the United States. The Domestic DVD segment derives revenues from monthly membership fees for services consisting solely of DVD-by-mail. Revenues and the related payment card fees are attributed to the operating segment based on the nature of the underlying membership (streaming or DVD) and the geographic region from which the membership originates. There are no internal revenue transactions between the Company’s segments.\n\nAmortization of streaming content assets makes up the vast majority of cost of revenues. The Company obtains multi-territory or global rights for its streaming content and allocates these rights between Domestic and International streaming segments based on estimated fair market value. Amortization of content assets and other expenses associated with the acquisition, licensing, and production of streaming content for each streaming segment thus includes both expenses directly incurred by the segment as well as an allocation of expenses incurred for global or multi-territory rights. Other costs of revenues such as delivery costs are primarily attributed to the operating segment based on amounts directly incurred by the segment. Marketing expenses consist primarily of advertising expenses and certain payments made to marketing partners, including CE manufacturers, MVPDs, mobile operators and ISPs, which are generally included in the segment in which the expenditures are directly incurred.\n\nThe Company's long-lived tangible assets were located as follows:\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

(“Netflix”, “the Company”, “we”, or “us”) is the world’s leading internet television network with over 93 million streaming members in over 190 countries enjoying more than 125 million hours of TV shows and movies per day, including original series, documentaries and feature films. Our members can watch as much as they want, anytime, anywhere, on nearly any internet-connected screen. Members can play, pause and resume watching, all without commercials or commitments. Additionally, in the United States ("U.S."), our members can receive DVDs delivered quickly to their homes.\n\nWe are a pioneer in the internet delivery of TV shows and movies, launching our streaming service in 2007. Since this launch, we have developed an ecosystem for internet-connected screens and have added increasing amounts of content that enable consumers to enjoy TV shows and movies directly on their internet-connected screens. As a result of these efforts, we have experienced growing consumer acceptance of, and interest in, the delivery of TV shows and movies directly over the internet.\n\nOur core strategy is to grow our streaming membership business globally within the parameters of our profit margin targets. We are continuously improving our members\' experience by expanding our streaming content with a focus on a programming mix of content that delights our members. In addition, we are perpetually enhancing our user interface and extending our streaming service to more internet-connected screens. Our members can now download a selection of titles for offline viewing.\n\nWe continue to grow our streaming service both domestically and internationally. We began our international expansion with Canada in 2010 and have since launched our service globally, with the exception of The People\'s Republic of China and territories where U.S. companies are not allowed to operate. We have also expanded our streaming content offering to include more exclusive and original programming, including several Emmy, Golden Globe and Academy Award nominated original series and documentaries. Our original programming increasingly includes content that we produce.\n\nBUSINESS SEGMENTS\n\nThe Company has three reportable segments: Domestic streaming, International streaming and Domestic DVD. The Domestic streaming segment derives revenues from monthly membership fees for services consisting solely of streaming content to our members in the United States. The International streaming segment derives revenues from monthly membership fees for services consisting solely of streaming content to our members outside the United States. The Domestic DVD segment derives revenues from monthly membership fees for services consisting solely of DVD-by-mail. For additional information regarding our segments, including information about our financial results by geography, see Note 11 of Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\n\n1', 'Table of Contents\n\nCOMPETITION\n\nThe market for entertainment video is intensely competitive and subject to rapid change. We compete against other entertainment video providers, such as multichannel video programming distributors ("MVPDs"), internet-based movie and TV content providers (including those that provide pirated content), video gaming providers and DVD rental outlets and more broadly against other sources of entertainment that our members could choose in their moments of free time. We also compete against entertainment video providers in obtaining content that our members love, both for licensed streaming content and for original content projects.\n\nWhile consumers may maintain simultaneous relationships with multiple entertainment sources, we strive for consumers to choose us in their moments of free time. We have often referred to this choice as our objective of "winning moments of truth." In attempting to win these moments of truth with our members, we are continually improving our service, including both our technology and our content, which is increasingly exclusive and curated, and includes our own original programming.\n\nSEASONALITY\n\nOur membership growth exhibits a seasonal pattern that reflects variations when consumers buy internet-connected screens and when they tend to increase their viewing. Historically, the first and fourth quarters (October through March)represent our greatest membership growth across our Domestic and International streaming segments. Our membership growth may be impacted by the release of certain high-profile original content. Internationally, we expect each market to demonstrate more predictable seasonal patterns as our service offering in each market becomes more established and we have a longer history to assess such patterns.\n\nINTELLECTUAL PROPERTY\n\nWe regard our trademarks, service marks, copyrights, patents, domain names, trade dress, trade secrets, proprietary technologies and similar intellectual property as important to our success. We use a combination of patent, trademark, copyright and trade secret laws and confidentiality agreements to protect our proprietary intellectual property. Our ability to protect and enforce our intellectual property rights is subject to certain risks and from time to time we encounter disputes over rights and obligations concerning intellectual property. We cannot provide assurance that we will prevail in any intellectual property disputes.\n\nEMPLOYEES\n\nAs of December\xa031, 2016, we had approximately 4,700 total employees. Of these employees, approximately 4,500 were full-time, including approximately 1,300 categorized as temporary.\n\nOTHER INFORMATION\n\nWe were incorporated in Delaware in August 1997 and completed our initial public offering in May 2002. Our principal executive offices are located at 100 Winchester Circle, Los Gatos, California 95032, and our telephone number is (408)\xa0540-3700.\n\nWe maintain a Web site at www.netflix.com. The contents of our Web site are not incorporated in, or otherwise to be regarded as part of, this Annual Report on Form 10-K. In this Annual Report on Form 10-K, “Netflix,” the “Company,” “we,” “us,” “our” and the “registrant” refer to Netflix, Inc. We make available, free of charge on our Web site, access to our Annual Report on Form 10-K, our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, our Current Reports on Form 8-K and amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), as soon as reasonably practicable after we file or furnish them electronically with the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC").\n\nInvestors and others should note that we announce material financial information to our investors using our investor relations Web site (http://ir.netflix.com), SEC filings, press releases, public conference calls and webcasts. We use these channels as well as social media to communicate with our members and the public about our company, our services and other issues. It is possible that the information we post on social media could be deemed to be material information. Therefore, we encourage investors, the media, and others interested in our company to review the information we post on the social media channels listed on our investor relations Web site.\n\n2', "Table of Contents\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  |  |\n| Item 1A. | Risk Factors |\n\nIf any of the following risks actually occur, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be harmed. In that case, the trading price of our common stock could decline, and you could lose all or part of your investment.\n\nRisks Related to Our Business\n\nIf our efforts to attract and retain members are not successful, our business will be adversely affected.\n\nWe have experienced significant membership growth over the past several years. Our ability to continue to attract members will depend in part on our ability to consistently provide our members with compelling content choices, as well as a quality experience for selecting and viewing TV shows and movies. Furthermore, the relative service levels, content offerings, pricing and related features of competitors to our service may adversely impact our ability to attract and retain memberships. Competitors include other entertainment video providers, such as MVPDs, internet-based movie and TV content providers (including those that provide pirated content) and DVD rental outlets. If consumers do not perceive our service offering to be of value, including if we introduce new or adjust existing features, adjust pricing or service offerings, or change the mix of content in a manner that is not favorably received by them, we may not be able to attract and retain members. In addition, many of our members rejoin our service or originate from word-of-mouth advertising from existing members. If our efforts to satisfy our existing members are not successful, we may not be able to attract members, and as a result, our ability to maintain and/or grow our business will be adversely affected. Members cancel our service for many reasons, including a perception that they do not use the service sufficiently, the need to cut household expenses, availability of content is unsatisfactory, competitive services provide a better value or experience and customer service issues are not satisfactorily resolved. We must continually add new memberships both to replace canceled memberships and to grow our business beyond our current membership base. If we do not grow as expected, given, in particular that our content costs are largely fixed in nature and contracted over several years, we may not be able to adjust our expenditures or increase our (per membership) revenues commensurate with the lowered growth rate such that our margins, liquidity and results of operation may be adversely impacted. If we are unable to successfully compete with current and new competitors in both retaining our existing memberships and attracting new memberships, our business will be adversely affected. Further, if excessive numbers of members cancel our service, we may be required to incur significantly higher marketing expenditures than we currently anticipate to replace these members with new members.\n\nChanges in competitive offerings for entertainment video, including the potential rapid adoption of piracy-based video offerings, could adversely impact our business.\n\nThe market for entertainment video is intensely competitive and subject to rapid change. Through new and existing distribution channels, consumers have increasing options to access entertainment video. The various economic models underlying these channels include subscription, transactional, ad-supported and piracy-based models. All of these have the potential to capture meaningful segments of the entertainment video market. Piracy, in particular, threatens to damage our business, as its fundamental proposition to consumers is so compelling and difficult to compete against: virtually all content for free. Furthermore, in light of the compelling consumer proposition, piracy services are subject to rapid global growth. Traditional providers of entertainment video, including broadcasters and cable network operators, as well as internet based e-commerce or entertainment video providers are increasing their internet-based video offerings.  Several of these competitors have long operating histories, large customer bases, strong brand recognition and significant financial, marketing and other resources. They may secure better terms from suppliers, adopt more aggressive pricing and devote more resources to product development, technology, infrastructure, content acquisitions and marketing. New entrants may enter the market or existing providers may adjust their services with unique offerings or approaches to providing entertainment video. Companies also may enter into business combinations or alliances that strengthen their competitive positions. If we are unable to successfully or profitably compete with current and new competitors, our business will be adversely affected, and we may not be able to increase or maintain market share, revenues or profitability.\n\nThe long-term and fixed cost nature of our content commitments may limit our operating flexibility and could adversely affect our liquidity and results of operations.\n\nIn connection with obtaining streaming content, we typically enter into multi-year commitments with studios and other content providers, the payment terms of which are not tied to member usage or the size of our membership base (“fixed cost”) but which may be tied to such factors as titles licensed and/or theatrical exhibition receipts. Such commitments are included in the Contractual Obligations section of Item\xa07, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Note 5, Commitments and Contingencies in Item 8. Given the multiple-year duration and largely fixed cost nature of content commitments, if membership acquisition and retention do not meet our expectations, our margins may be\n\n3", 'Table of Contents\n\nadversely impacted. Payment terms for certain content commitments, such as programming that is initially available in the applicable territory on our service (“original programming”), will typically require more up-front cash payments than other licensing agreements. To the extent membership and/or revenue growth do not meet our expectations, our liquidity and results of operations could be adversely affected as a result of content commitments and accelerated payment requirements of certain agreements. In addition, the long-term and fixed cost nature of our content commitments may limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to changes in our business and the market segments in which we operate. If we license content that is not favorably received by consumers in a territory, or is unable to be shown in a territory, acquisition and retention may be adversely impacted and given the long-term and fixed cost nature of our content commitments, we may not be able to adjust our content offering quickly and our results of operation may be adversely impacted.\n\nWe are devoting more resources toward the development, production, marketing and distribution of original programming, including TV series and movies. We believe that original programming can help differentiate our service from other offerings, enhance our brand and otherwise attract and retain members. To the extent our original programming does not meet our expectations, in particular, in terms of costs, viewing and popularity, our business, including our brand and results of operations may be adversely impacted.\n\nIf we are not able to manage change and growth, our business could be adversely affected.\n\nWe are expanding our operations internationally, scaling our streaming service to effectively and reliably handle anticipated growth in both members and features related to our service, ramping up our ability to produce original content, as well as continuing to operate our DVD service within the U.S. As our international offering evolves, we are managing and adjusting our business to address varied content offerings, consumer customs and practices, in particular those dealing with e-commerce and internet video, as well as differing legal and regulatory environments. As we scale our streaming service, we are developing technology and utilizing third-party “cloud” computing services. As we ramp up our original content production, we are building out expertise in a number of disciplines, including creative, marketing, legal, finance and other resources related to the development and physical production of content. If we are not able to manage the growing complexity of our business, including improving, refining or revising our systems and operational practices related to our streaming operations and original content, our business may be adversely affected.\n\nWe could be subject to economic, political, regulatory and other risks arising from our international operations.\n\nOperating in international markets requires significant resources and management attention and will subject us to regulatory, economic and political risks that may be different from or incremental to those in the U.S. In addition to the risks that we face in the U.S., our international operations involve risks that could adversely affect our business, including:\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  |  |\n| • | the need to adapt our content and user interfaces for specific cultural and language differences, including licensing a certain portion of our content assets before we have developed a full appreciation for its performance within a given territory; |\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  |  |\n| • | difficulties and costs associated with staffing and managing foreign operations; |\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  |  |\n| • | management distraction; |\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  |  |\n| • | political or social unrest and economic instability; |\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  |  |\n| • | compliance with U.S. laws such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, export controls and economic sanctions, and local laws prohibiting corrupt payments to government officials; |\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  |  |\n| • | difficulties in understanding and complying with local laws, regulations and customs in foreign jurisdictions; |\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  |  |\n| • | regulatory requirements or government action against our service, whether in response to enforcement of actual or purported legal and regulatory requirements or otherwise, that results in disruption or non-availability of our service or particular content in the applicable jurisdiction; |\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  |  |\n| • | less favorable foreign intellectual property laws; |\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  |  |\n| • | adverse domestic or international tax consequences such as those related to repatriation of cash from foreign jurisdictions into the United States, non-income related taxes such as value-added tax or other indirect taxes, changes in tax laws or tax rates or their interpretations and the related application of judgment in determining our global provision for income taxes, deferred tax assets or liabilities or other tax liabilities given the ultimate tax determination is uncertain; |\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  |  |\n| • | fluctuations in currency exchange rates, which we do not use foreign exchange contracts or derivatives to hedge against and which could impact revenues and expenses of our international operations and expose us to foreign currency exchange rate risk; |\n\n4', 'Table of Contents\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  |  |\n| • | profit repatriation and other restrictions on the transfer of funds; |\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  |  |\n| • | differing payment processing systems as well as consumer use and acceptance of electronic payment methods, such as payment cards; |\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  |  |\n| • | new and different sources of competition; |\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  |  |\n| • | censorship requirements that cause us to remove or edit popular content, leading to consumer disappointment or dissatisfaction with our service; |\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  |  |\n| • | low usage and/or penetration of internet-connected consumer electronic devices; |\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  |  |\n| • | different and more stringent user protection, data protection, privacy and other laws; |\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  |  |\n| • | availability of reliable broadband connectivity and wide area networks in targeted areas for expansion; |\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  |  |\n| • | integration and operational challenges as well as potential unknown liabilities in connection with companies we may acquire or control; and |\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  |  |\n| • | differing, and often more lenient, laws and consumer understanding/attitudes regarding the illegality of piracy. |\n\nOur failure to manage any of these risks successfully could harm our international operations and our overall business, and results of our operations.\n\nIf we fail to maintain or, in newer markets establish, a positive reputation with consumers concerning our service, including the content we offer, we may not be able to attract or retain members, and our operating results may be adversely affected.\n\nWe believe that a positive reputation with consumers concerning our service is important in attracting and retaining members who have a number of choices from which to obtain entertainment video. To the extent our content, in particular, our original programming, is perceived as low quality, offensive or otherwise not compelling to consumers, our ability to establish and maintain a positive reputation may be adversely impacted. Furthermore, to the extent our marketing, customer service and public relations efforts are not effective or result in negative consumer reaction, our ability to establish and maintain a positive reputation may likewise be adversely impacted. With newer markets, we also need to establish our reputation with consumers and to the extent we are not successful in creating positive impressions, our business in these new markets may be adversely impacted.\n\nChanges in how we market our service could adversely affect our marketing expenses and membership levels may be adversely affected.\n\nWe utilize a broad mix of marketing and public relations programs, including social media sites such as Facebook and Twitter, to promote our service to potential new members. We may limit or discontinue use or support of certain marketing sources or activities if advertising rates increase or if we become concerned that members or potential members deem certain marketing practices intrusive or damaging to our brand. If the available marketing channels are curtailed, our ability to attract new members may be adversely affected.\n\nIf companies that promote our service decide that we negatively impact their business, that they want to compete more directly with our business or enter a similar business or decide to exclusively support our competitors, we may no longer have access to such marketing channels. We also acquire a number of members who rejoin our service having previously cancelled their membership. If we are unable to maintain or replace our sources of members with similarly effective sources, or if the cost of our existing sources increases, our member levels and marketing expenses may be adversely affected\n\nWe face risks, such as unforeseen costs and potential liability in connection with content we acquire, produce, license and/or distribute through our service.\n\nAs a distributor of content, we face potential liability for negligence, copyright and trademark infringement, or other claims based on the nature and content of materials that we acquire, produce, license and/or distribute. We also may face potential liability for content used in promoting our service, including marketing materials and features on our Web site such as member reviews. As we expand our original programming, we have become responsible for production costs and other expenses, such as ongoing guild payments. We also take on risks associated with production, such as completion and key talent risk. Negotiations or renewals related to entertainment industry collective bargaining agreements could negatively impact timing and costs associated with our productions. To the extent we do not accurately anticipate costs or mitigate risks, including for content that we obtain but ultimately does not appear on our service, or if we become liable for content we acquire, produce, license and/or distribute, our business may suffer. Litigation to defend these claims could be costly and the expenses and\n\n5', "Table of Contents\n\ndamages arising from any liability or unforeseen production risks could harm our results of operations. We may not be indemnified against claims or costs of these types and we may not have insurance coverage for these types of claims.\n\nIf studios, content providers or other rights holders refuse to license streaming content or other rights upon terms acceptable to us, our business could be adversely affected.\n\nOur ability to provide our members with content they can watch depends on studios, content providers and other rights holders licensing rights to distribute such content and certain related elements thereof, such as the public performance of music contained within the content we distribute. The license periods and the terms and conditions of such licenses vary. If the studios, content providers and other rights holders are not or are no longer willing or able to license us content upon terms acceptable to us, our ability to stream content to our members will be adversely affected and/or our costs could increase. Many of the licenses for content provide for the studios or other content providers to withdraw content from our service relatively quickly. Because of these provisions as well as other actions we may take, content available through our service can be withdrawn on short notice. As competition increases, we may see the cost of programming increase. As we seek to differentiate our service, we are increasingly focused on securing certain exclusive rights when obtaining content, including original content. We are also focused on programming an overall mix of content that delights our members in a cost efficient manner. Within this context, we are selective about the titles we add and renew to our service. If we do not maintain a compelling mix of content, our membership acquisition and retention may be adversely affected.\n\nMusic contained within content we distribute may require us to obtain licenses for such distribution. In this regard, we engage in negotiations with collection management organizations (“CMOs”) that hold certain rights to music interests in connection with streaming content into various territories. If we are unable to reach mutually acceptable terms with these organizations, we could become involved in litigation and/or could be enjoined from distributing certain content, which could adversely impact our business. Additionally, pending and ongoing litigation as well as negotiations between certain CMOs and other third parties in various territories could adversely impact our negotiations with CMOs, or result in music publishers represented by certain CMOs unilaterally withdrawing rights, and thereby adversely impact our ability to reach licensing agreements reasonably acceptable to us. Failure to reach such licensing agreements could expose us to potential liability for copyright infringement or otherwise increase our costs.\n\nWe rely upon a number of partners to make our service available on their devices.\n\nWe currently offer members the ability to receive streaming content through a host of internet-connected screens, including TVs, digital video players, television set-top boxes and mobile devices. We have agreements with various cable, satellite and telecommunications operators to make our service available through the television set-top boxes of these service providers.  We intend to continue to broaden our capability to instantly stream TV shows and movies to other platforms and partners over time. If we are not successful in maintaining existing and creating new relationships, or if we encounter technological, content licensing, regulatory or other impediments to delivering our streaming content to our members via these devices, our ability to grow our business could be adversely impacted. Our agreements with our device partners are typically between one and three years in duration and our business could be adversely affected if, upon expiration, a number of our partners do not continue to provide access to our service or are unwilling to do so on terms acceptable to us, which terms may include the degree of accessibility and prominence of our service. Furthermore, devices are manufactured and sold by entities other than Netflix and while these entities should be responsible for the devices' performance, the connection between these devices and Netflix may nonetheless result in consumer dissatisfaction toward Netflix and such dissatisfaction could result in claims against us or otherwise adversely impact our business. In addition, technology changes to our streaming functionality may require that partners update their devices. If partners do not update or otherwise modify their devices, our service and our members' use and enjoyment could be negatively impacted.\n\nAny significant disruption in or unauthorized access to our computer systems or those of third parties that we utilize in our operations, including those relating to cybersecurity or arising from cyber-attacks, could result in a loss or degradation of service, unauthorized disclosure of data, including member and corporate information, or theft of intellectual property, including digital content assets, which could adversely impact our business.\n\nOur reputation and ability to attract, retain and serve our members is dependent upon the reliable performance and security of our computer systems and those of third parties that we utilize in our operations. These systems may be subject to damage or interruption from earthquakes, adverse weather conditions, other natural disasters, terrorist attacks, power loss, telecommunications failures, and cybersecurity risks. Interruptions in these systems, or with the internet in general, could make our service unavailable or degraded or otherwise hinder our ability to deliver streaming content or fulfill DVD selections. Service interruptions, errors in our software or the unavailability of computer systems used in our operations could diminish the overall attractiveness of our membership service to existing and potential members.\n\n6", 'Table of Contents\n\nOur computer systems and those of third parties we use in our operations are vulnerable to cybersecurity risks, including cyber-attacks such as computer viruses, denial of service attacks, physical or electronic break-ins and similar disruptions. These systems periodically experience directed attacks intended to lead to interruptions and delays in our service and operations as well as loss, misuse or theft of data. Any attempt by hackers to obtain our data (including member and corporate information) or intellectual property (including digital content assets), disrupt our service, or otherwise access our systems, or those of third parties we use, if successful, could harm our business, be expensive to remedy and damage our reputation. We have implemented certain systems and processes to thwart hackers and protect our data and systems. To date hackers have not had a material impact on our service or systems however this is no assurance that hackers may not be successful in the future. Our insurance does not cover expenses related to such disruptions or unauthorized access. Efforts to prevent hackers from disrupting our service or otherwise accessing our systems are expensive to implement and may limit the functionality of or otherwise negatively impact our service offering and systems. Any significant disruption to our service or access to our systems could result in a loss of memberships and adversely affect our business and results of operation.\n\nWe utilize our own communications and computer hardware systems located either in our facilities or in that of a third-party Web hosting provider. In addition, we utilize third-party “cloud” computing services in connection with our business operations. We also utilize our own and third-party content delivery networks to help us stream TV shows and movies in high volume to Netflix members over the internet. Problems faced by us or our third-party Web hosting, "cloud" computing, or other network providers, including technological or business-related disruptions, as well as cybersecurity threats, could adversely impact the experience of our members.\n\nWe rely upon Amazon Web Services to operate certain aspects of our service and any disruption of or interference with our use of the Amazon Web Services operation would impact our operations and our business would be adversely impacted.\n\nAmazon Web Services ("AWS") provides a distributed computing infrastructure platform for business operations, or what is commonly referred to as a "cloud" computing service. We have architected our software and computer systems so as to utilize data processing, storage capabilities and other services provided by AWS. Currently, we run the vast majority of our computing on AWS. Given this, along with the fact that we cannot easily switch our AWS operations to another cloud provider, any disruption of or interference with our use of AWS would impact our operations and our business would be adversely impacted. While the retail side of Amazon competes with us, we do not believe that Amazon will use the AWS operation in such a manner as to gain competitive advantage against our service.\n\nIf the technology we use in operating our business fails, is unavailable, or does not operate to expectations, our business and results of operation could be adversely impacted.\n\nWe utilize a combination of proprietary and third party technology to operate our business. This includes the technology that we have developed to recommend and merchandise content to our consumers as well as enable fast and efficient delivery of content to our members and their various consumer electronic devices. For example, we have built and deployed our own content-delivery network (“CDN”). To the extent Internet Service Providers ("ISPs") do not interconnect with our CDN, or if we experience difficulties in its operation, our ability to efficiently and effectively deliver our streaming content to our members could be adversely impacted and our business and results of operation could be adversely affected. Likewise, if our recommendation and merchandising technology does not enable us to predict and recommend titles that our members will enjoy, our ability to attract and retain members may be adversely affected. We also utilize third party technology to help market our service, process payments, and otherwise manage the daily operations of our business. If our technology or that of third parties we utilize in our operations fails or otherwise operates improperly, our ability to operate our service, retain existing members and add new members may be impaired. Also, any harm to our members\' personal computers or other devices caused by software used in our operations could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\n\nIf government regulations relating to the internet or other areas of our business change, we may need to alter the manner in which we conduct our business, or incur greater operating expenses.\n\nThe adoption or modification of laws or regulations relating to the internet or other areas of our business could limit or otherwise adversely affect the manner in which we currently conduct our business. In addition, the continued growth and development of the market for online commerce may lead to more stringent consumer protection laws, which may impose additional burdens on us. If we are required to comply with new regulations or legislation or new interpretations of existing regulations or legislation, this compliance could cause us to incur additional expenses or alter our business model.\n\nChanges in laws or regulations that adversely affect the growth, popularity or use of the internet, including laws impacting net neutrality, could decrease the demand for our service and increase our cost of doing business. Certain laws\n\n7', "Table of Contents\n\nintended to prevent network operators from discriminating against the legal traffic that traverse their networks have been implemented in many countries, including the United States and the European Union. In others, the laws may be nascent or non-existent. Given uncertainty around these rules, including changing interpretations, amendments or repeal, coupled with potentially significant political and economic power of local network operators, we could experience discriminatory or anti-competitive practices that could impede our growth, cause us to incur additional expense or otherwise negatively affect our business.\n\nChanges in how network operators handle and charge for access to data that travel across their networks could adversely impact our business.\n\nWe rely upon the ability of consumers to access our service through the internet. If network operators block, restrict or otherwise impair access to our service over their networks, our service and business could be negatively affected. To the extent that network operators implement usage based pricing, including meaningful bandwidth caps, or otherwise try to monetize access to their networks by data providers, we could incur greater operating expenses and our membership acquisition and retention could be negatively impacted. Furthermore, to the extent network operators create tiers of internet access service and either charge us for or prohibit us from being available through these tiers, our business could be negatively impacted.\n\nMost network operators that provide consumers with access to the internet also provide these consumers with multichannel video programming. As such, many network operators have an incentive to use their network infrastructure in a manner adverse to our continued growth and success. While we believe that consumer demand, regulatory oversight and competition will help check these incentives, to the extent that network operators are able to provide preferential treatment to their data as opposed to ours or otherwise implement discriminatory network management practices, our business could be negatively impacted. In some international markets, these same incentives apply however, the consumer demand, regulatory oversight and competition may not be as strong as in our domestic market.\n\nPrivacy concerns could limit our ability to collect and leverage our membership data and disclosure of membership data could adversely impact our business and reputation.\n\nIn the ordinary course of business and in particular in connection with merchandising our service to our members, we collect and utilize data supplied by our members. We currently face certain legal obligations regarding the manner in which we treat such information. Other businesses have been criticized by privacy groups and governmental bodies for attempts to link personal identities and other information to data collected on the internet regarding users' browsing and other habits. Increased regulation of data utilization practices, including self-regulation or findings under existing laws that limit our ability to collect, transfer and use data, could have an adverse effect on our business. In addition, if we were to disclose data about our members in a manner that was objectionable to them, our business reputation could be adversely affected, and we could face potential legal claims that could impact our operating results. Internationally, we may become subject to additional and/or more stringent legal obligations concerning our treatment of customer and other personal information, such as laws regarding data localization and/or restrictions on data export. Failure to comply with these obligations could subject us to liability, and to the extent that we need to alter our business model or practices to adapt to these obligations, we could incur additional expenses.\n\nOur reputation and relationships with members would be harmed if our membership data, particularly billing data, were to be accessed by unauthorized persons.\n\nWe maintain personal data regarding our members, including names and billing data. This data is maintained on our own systems as well as that of third parties we use in our operations. With respect to billing data, such as credit card numbers, we rely on licensed encryption and authentication technology to secure such information. We take measures to protect against unauthorized intrusion into our members' data. Despite these measures we, our payment processing services or other third party services we use such as AWS, could experience an unauthorized intrusion into our members' data. In the event of such a breach, current and potential members may become unwilling to provide the information to us necessary for them to become members. Additionally, we could face legal claims or regulatory fines or penalties for such a breach. The costs relating to any data breach could be material, and we currently do not carry insurance against the risk of a data breach. For these reasons, should an unauthorized intrusion into our members’ data occur, our business could be adversely affected.\n\n8", "Table of Contents\n\nWe are subject to payment processing risk.\n\nOur members pay for our service using a variety of different payment methods, including credit and debit cards, gift cards, direct debit and online wallets.\xa0 We rely on internal systems as well as those of third parties to process payment.\xa0 Acceptance and processing of these payment methods are subject to certain rules and regulations and require payment of interchange and other fees.\xa0 To the extent there are disruptions in our payment processing systems,\xa0increases in payment processing fees, material changes in the payment ecosystem, such as large re-issuances of payment cards, delays in receiving payments from payment processors and/or changes to rules or regulations concerning payment processing, our revenue, operating expenses and results of operation could be adversely impacted.\xa0\xa0 In addition, from time to time, we encounter fraudulent use of payment methods, which could impact our results of operation and if not adequately controlled and managed could create negative consumer perceptions of our service.\n\nIf our trademarks and other proprietary rights are not adequately protected to prevent use or appropriation by our competitors, the value of our brand and other intangible assets may be diminished, and our business may be adversely affected.\n\nWe rely and expect to continue to rely on a combination of confidentiality and license agreements with our employees, consultants and third parties with whom we have relationships, as well as trademark, copyright, patent and trade secret protection laws, to protect our proprietary rights. We may also seek to enforce our proprietary rights through court proceedings. We have filed and we expect to file from time to time for trademark and patent applications. Nevertheless, these applications may not be approved, third parties may challenge any copyrights, patents or trademarks issued to or held by us, third parties may knowingly or unknowingly infringe our intellectual property rights, and we may not be able to prevent infringement or misappropriation without substantial expense to us. If the protection of our intellectual property rights is inadequate to prevent use or misappropriation by third parties, the value of our brand and other intangible assets may be diminished, competitors may be able to more effectively mimic our service and methods of operations, the perception of our business and service to members and potential members may become confused in the marketplace, and our ability to attract members may be adversely affected.\n\nWe currently hold various domain names relating to our brand, including Netflix.com. Failure to protect our domain names could adversely affect our reputation and brand and make it more difficult for users to find our Web site and our service. We may be unable, without significant cost or at all, to prevent third parties from acquiring domain names that are similar to, infringe upon or otherwise decrease the value of our trademarks and other proprietary rights.\n\nIntellectual property claims against us could be costly and result in the loss of significant rights related to, among other things, our Web site, streaming technology, our recommendation and merchandising technology, title selection processes and marketing activities.\n\nTrademark, copyright, patent and other intellectual property rights are important to us and other companies. Our intellectual property rights extend to our technology, business processes and the content on our Web site. We use the intellectual property of third parties in merchandising our products and marketing our service through contractual and other rights. From time to time, third parties allege that we have violated their intellectual property rights. If we are unable to obtain sufficient rights, successfully defend our use, or develop non-infringing technology or otherwise alter our business practices on a timely basis in response to claims against us for infringement, misappropriation, misuse or other violation of third-party intellectual property rights, our business and competitive position may be adversely affected. Many companies are devoting significant resources to developing patents that could potentially affect many aspects of our business. There are numerous patents that broadly claim means and methods of conducting business on the internet. We have not searched patents relative to our technology. Defending ourselves against intellectual property claims, whether they are with or without merit or are determined in our favor, results in costly litigation and diversion of technical and management personnel. It also may result in our inability to use our current Web site, streaming technology, our recommendation and merchandising technology or inability to market our service or merchandise our products. As a result of a dispute, we may have to develop non-infringing technology, enter into royalty or licensing agreements, adjust our merchandising or marketing activities or take other actions to resolve the claims. These actions, if required, may be costly or unavailable on terms acceptable to us.\n\nWe are engaged in legal proceedings that could cause us to incur unforeseen expenses and could occupy a significant amount of our management's time and attention.\n\nFrom time to time, we are subject to litigation or claims that could negatively affect our business operations and financial position. As we have grown, we have seen a rise in the number of litigation matters against us. These matters have included patent infringements as well as consumer and securities class actions, each of which are typically expensive to defend. Litigation disputes could cause us to incur unforeseen expenses, could occupy a significant amount of our management's time and attention and could negatively affect our business operations and financial position.\n\n9", 'Table of Contents\n\nWe may seek additional capital that may result in stockholder dilution or that may have rights senior to those of our common stockholders.\n\nFrom time to time, we may seek to obtain additional capital, either through equity, equity-linked or debt securities. The decision to obtain additional capital will depend on, among other things, our business plans, operating performance and condition of the capital markets. If we raise additional funds through the issuance of equity, equity-linked or debt securities, those securities may have rights, preferences or privileges senior to the rights of our common stock, and our stockholders may experience dilution.\n\nWe have a substantial amount of indebtedness and other obligations, including streaming content obligations, which could adversely affect our financial position.\n\nWe have a substantial amount of indebtedness and other obligations, including streaming content obligations. As of December 31, 2016, we had $3.4 billion aggregate principal amount of senior notes outstanding (“Notes”). As of December 31, 2016, we had approximately $6.5 billion of total content liabilities as reflected on our consolidated balance sheet. Such amount does not include streaming content commitments that do not meet the criteria for liability recognition, the amounts of which are significant. For more information on our streaming content obligations, including those not on our consolidated balance sheet, see Note 5, Commitments and Contingencies. Our substantial indebtedness and other obligations, including streaming content obligations, may:\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  |  |\n| • | make it difficult for us to satisfy our financial obligations, including making scheduled principal and interest payments on our Notes and our other obligations; |\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  |  |\n| • | limit our ability to borrow additional funds for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions or other general business purposes; |\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  |  |\n| • | limit our ability to use our cash flow or obtain additional financing for future working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions or other general business purposes; |\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  |  |\n| • | require us to use a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to make debt service payments and pay our other obligations when due; |\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  |  |\n| • | limit our flexibility to plan for, or react to, changes in our business and industry; |\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  |  |\n| • | place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our less leveraged competitors; and |\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  |  |\n| • | increase our vulnerability to the impact of adverse economic and industry conditions. |\n\nWe may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service our debt and other obligations.\n\nOur ability to make payments on our indebtedness, including our Notes, and our other obligations will depend on our financial and operating performance, which is subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions and to certain financial, business and other factors beyond our control. We may be unable to maintain a level of cash flows from operating activities sufficient to permit us to pay the principal, premium, if any, and interest on our indebtedness, including the Notes, and other obligations, including amounts due under our streaming content obligations.\n\nIf our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service and other obligations, we may be forced to reduce or delay investments and capital expenditures, or to sell assets, seek additional capital or restructure or refinance our indebtedness, including the Notes and obligations such as our streaming content obligations. These alternative measures may not be successful and may not permit us to meet our scheduled debt service and other obligations. We cannot assure you that we would be able to implement any of these alternatives on satisfactory terms or at all. In the absence of such operating results and resources, we could face substantial liquidity problems and might be required to dispose of material assets or operations to meet our debt service and other obligations. We may not be able to consummate those dispositions or to obtain the proceeds that we could realize from them, and these proceeds may not be adequate to meet any debt service obligations or other obligations then due.\n\nIf we are unable to service our debt obligations from cash flows, we may need to refinance all or a portion of our debt obligations prior to maturity. Our ability to refinance or restructure our debt will depend upon the condition of the capital markets and our financial condition at such time. Any refinancing of our debt could be at higher interest rates and may require us to comply with more onerous covenants, which could further restrict our business operations. We may not be able to refinance any of our indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms or at all.\n\nWe may lose key employees or may be unable to hire qualified employees.\n\n10', "Table of Contents\n\nWe rely on the continued service of our senior management, including our Chief Executive Officer and co-founder Reed Hastings, members of our executive team and other key employees and the hiring of new qualified employees. In our industry, there is substantial and continuous competition for highly-skilled business, product development, technical and other personnel. We may not be successful in recruiting new personnel and in retaining and motivating existing personnel, which may be disruptive to our operations.\n\nIf our Domestic DVD segment declines faster than anticipated, our business could be adversely affected.\n\nThe number of memberships to our DVD-by-mail offering is declining, and we anticipate that this decline will continue. We believe, however, that the domestic DVD business will continue to generate significant contribution profit for our business. The contribution profit generated by our domestic DVD business will help provide capital resources to fund our growth internationally. To the extent that the rate of decline in our DVD-by-mail business is greater than we anticipate, our business could be adversely affected. We do not anticipate increasing resources to our DVD operations and the technology used in its operations will not be meaningfully improved. To the extent that we experience service interruptions or other degradations in our DVD-by-mail service, members' satisfaction could be negatively impacted and we could experience an increase in DVD-by-mail member cancellations, which could adversely impact our business.\n\nIf the U.S. Postal Service were to increase postal delivery rates or implement other changes to improve its financial position, such as closing mail processing facilities or service reductions, such changes could lead to a decrease in customer satisfaction and our Domestic DVD segment's contribution profit could be adversely affected.\n\nRisks Related to Our Stock Ownership\n\nProvisions in our charter documents and under Delaware law could discourage a takeover that stockholders may consider favorable.\n\nOur charter documents may discourage, delay or prevent a merger or acquisition that a stockholder may consider favorable because they:\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  |  |\n| • | authorize our board of directors, without stockholder approval, to issue up to 10,000,000 shares of undesignated preferred stock; |\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  |  |\n| • | provide for a classified board of directors; |\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  |  |\n| • | prohibit our stockholders from acting by written consent; |\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  |  |\n| • | establish advance notice requirements for proposing matters to be approved by stockholders at stockholder meetings; and |\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  |  |\n| • | prohibit stockholders from calling a special meeting of stockholders. |\n\nAs a Delaware corporation, we are also subject to certain Delaware anti-takeover provisions. Under Delaware law, a corporation may not engage in a business combination with any holder of 15% or more of its capital stock unless the holder has held the stock for three years or, among other things, the board of directors has approved the transaction. Our board of directors could rely on Delaware law to prevent or delay an acquisition of us.\n\nIn addition, a merger or acquisition may trigger retention payments to certain executive employees under the terms of our Amended and Restated Executive Severance and Retention Incentive Plan, thereby increasing the cost of such a transaction.\n\nOur stock price is volatile.\n\nThe price at which our common stock has traded has fluctuated significantly. The price may continue to be volatile due to a number of factors including the following, some of which are beyond our control:\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  |  |\n| • | variations in our operating results, including our membership acquisition and retention, revenues, contribution profits, net income and free cash flow; |\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  |  |\n| • | variations between our actual operating results and the expectations of securities analysts, investors and the financial community; |\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  |  |\n| • | announcements of developments affecting our business, systems or expansion plans by us or others; |\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  |  |\n| • | competition, including the introduction of new competitors, their pricing strategies and services; |\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  |  |\n| • | market volatility in general; |\n\n11", 'Table of Contents\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  |  |\n| • | the level of demand for our stock, including the amount of short interest in our stock; and |\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  |  |\n| • | the operating results of our competitors. |\n\nAs a result of these and other factors, investors in our common stock may not be able to resell their shares at or above their original purchase price.\n\nFollowing certain periods of volatility in the market price of our securities, we became the subject of securities litigation. We may experience more such litigation following future periods of volatility. This type of litigation may result in substantial costs and a diversion of management’s attention and resources.\n\nFinancial forecasting may differ materially from actual results.\n\nGiven the dynamic nature of our business, and the inherent limitations in predicting the future, forecasts of our revenues, contribution margins, net income and number of total and paid membership additions and other financial and operating data may differ materially from actual results. Such discrepancies could cause a decline in the trading price of our common stock.\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  |  |\n| Item 1B. | Unresolved Staff Comments |\n\nNone.\n\n12', 'Table of Contents\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  |  |\n| Item 2. | Properties |\n\nOur corporate headquarters are located in Los Gatos, California and consist of leased space aggregating approximately 600,000 square feet.\n\nIn the United States, we lease other offices in various locations, including Beverly Hills, California for content acquisition, marketing and general and administrative operations and Fremont, California for our DVD operations.

The impact from membership growth was coupled with an increase in global streaming average monthly revenue per paying membership resulting from price changes and plan mix partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency fluctuations impacting our International streaming segment. The increase in operating income and net income is due primarily to increased revenues partially offset by increased content expenses as we continue to acquire, license and produce content, including more Netflix originals, as well as increased marketing and headcount costs to support our international expansion. Net income was further impacted by the increase in interest expense associated with our debt issuances as well as to an increase in our effective tax rate, slightly offset by gains on foreign currency denominated transactions. We intend to focus on growing our global operating margin in 2017.\n\nWe offer three types of streaming membership plans. In the U.S. our "basic" plan is priced at $7.99 per month and includes access to standard definition quality streaming on a single screen at a time. Our "standard" plan is our most popular streaming plan and is priced at $9.99 per month and includes access to high definition quality streaming on two screens concurrently. Our "premium" plan is priced at $11.99 per month and includes access to high definition and ultra-high definition quality content on four screens concurrently. Internationally, the membership plans are structured similarly to the U.S. and range in price from the U.S. dollar equivalent of approximately $5.00 to $18.00 per month.\n\nWe expect that from time to time the prices of our membership plans in each country may change. For instance, in May 2014, in the U.S., we increased the price of our standard plan from $7.99 per month to $8.99 per month with existing memberships grandfathered for a two year period. In October 2015, in the U.S., we increased the price of this same standard plan from $8.99 per month to $9.99 per month with existing memberships grandfathered for a one year period. In 2016, we phased out grandfathered pricing, giving members the option of electing the basic streaming plan at $7.99 per month, continuing on the standard streaming plan at the higher price of $9.99 per month, or electing the premium plan at $11.99 per month.\n\nThe following represents the key elements to our segment results of operations:\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  |  |\n| • | We define contribution profit (loss) as revenues less cost of revenues and marketing expenses incurred by the segment. We believe this is an important measure of our operating segment performance as it represents each segment\'s performance before global corporate costs. |\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  |  |\n| • | For the Domestic and International streaming segments, content expenses, which include the amortization of the streaming content assets and other expenses associated with the licensing and acquisition of streaming content, represent the vast majority of cost of revenues. Streaming content rights were generally obtained for our current geographic regions. As we expanded internationally, we obtained additional rights for the new geographies. With our global expansion, we now aspire to obtain global rights for our content. We allocate this content between the Domestic and International segments based on estimated fair market value. Other cost of revenues such as streaming delivery expenses, customer service and payment processing fees, including those we pay to our integrated payment partners, tend to be lower as a percentage of total cost of revenues . We have built our own global content delivery network ("Open Connect") to help us efficiently stream a high volume of content to our members over the internet. Streaming |\n\n18', "Table of Contents\n\ndelivery expenses, therefore, include equipment costs related to Open Connect and all third-party costs, such as cloud computing costs, associated with delivering streaming content over the internet. Cost of revenues in the Domestic DVD segment consist primarily of delivery expenses, content expenses, including amortization of DVD content assets and revenue sharing expenses, and other expenses associated with our DVD processing and customer service centers. Delivery expenses for the Domestic DVD segment consist of the postage costs to mail DVDs to and from our members and the packaging and label costs for the mailers.\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  |  |\n| • | For the Domestic and International streaming segments, marketing expenses consist primarily of advertising expenses and payments made to our partners including device partners, MVPD's, mobile platforms and ISP's. Advertising expenses include promotional activities such as digital and television advertising. Payments to our partners include fixed fee and /or revenue sharing payments. Marketing expenses are incurred by our Domestic and International streaming segments given our focus on building consumer awareness of the streaming offerings, and in particular our original content. Marketing expenses incurred by our International streaming segment have been significant and fluctuate dependent upon the number of international territories in which our streaming service is offered and the timing of the launch of new territories. |\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  |  |\n| • | We have demonstrated our ability to grow domestic streaming contribution margin as evidenced by the increase in contribution margin from 17% in 2012 to 36% in 2016. As a result of our focus on growing the streaming segments, contribution margins for the Domestic and International streaming segments are lower than for our Domestic DVD segment. |\n\n19", 'Table of Contents\n\nSegment Results\n\nDomestic Streaming Segment\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|  |  | As of/ Year Ended December 31, | | | | | | | | | | |  | Change | | | | | | | | | | | | |\n|  |  | 2016 | | |  | 2015 | | |  | 2014 | | |  | 2016 vs. 2015 | | | | | |  | 2015 vs. 2014 | | | | | |\n|  |  | (in thousands, except revenue per membership and percentages) | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |\n| Memberships: |  |  | | |  |  | | |  |  | | |  |  | | |  |  | |  |  | | |  |  | |\n| Net additions |  | 4,693 | |  |  | 5,624 | |  |  | 5,694 | |  |  | (931 | | ) |  | (17 | )% |  | (70 | | ) |  | (1 | )% |\n| Memberships at end of period |  | 49,431 | |  |  | 44,738 | |  |  | 39,114 | |  |  | 4,693 | |  |  | 10 | % |  | 5,624 | |  |  | 14 | % |\n| Paid memberships at end of period |  | 47,905 | |  |  | 43,401 | |  |  | 37,698 | |  |  | 4,504 | |  |  | 10 | % |  | 5,703 | |  |  | 15 | % |\n| Average monthly revenue per paying membership |  | $9.21 | | |  | $8.50 | | |  | $8.14 | | |  | $0.71 | | |  | 8 | % |  | $0.36 | | |  | 4 | % |\n|  |  |  | | |  |  | | |  |  | | |  |  | | |  |  | |  |  | | |  |  | |\n| Contribution profit: |  |  | | |  |  | | |  |  | | |  |  | | |  |  | |  |  | | |  |  | |\n| Revenues |  | $ | 5,077,307 |  |  | $ | 4,180,339 |  |  | $ | 3,431,434 |  |  | $ | 896,968 |  |  | 21 | % |  | $ | 748,905 |  |  | 22 | % |\n| Cost of revenues |  | 2,855,789 | |  |  | 2,487,193 | |  |  | 2,201,761 | |  |  | 368,596 | |  |  | 15 | % |  | 285,432 | |  |  | 13 | % |\n| Marketing |  | 382,832 | |  |  | 317,646 | |  |  | 293,453 | |  |  | 65,186 | |  |  | 21 | % |  | 24,193 | |  |  | 8 | % |\n| Contribution profit |  | 1,838,686 | |  |  | 1,375,500 | |  |  | 936,220 | |  |  | 463,186 | |  |  | 34 | % |  | 439,280 | |  |  | 47 | % |\n| Contribution margin |  | 36 | | % |  | 33 | | % |  | 27 | | % |  |  | | |  |  | |  |  | | |  |  | |\n\nYear ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2015\n\nIn the Domestic streaming segment, we derive revenues from monthly membership fees for services consisting solely of streaming content to our members in the United States. The increase in our domestic streaming revenues was due to a 12% growth in the average number of paid memberships and an 8% increase in average monthly revenue per paying membership. The average monthly revenue per paying membership for the fourth quarter of 2016 increased by 15% compared to the same quarter in prior year. These increases in average monthly revenue per paying membership resulted from our price changes and plan mix. In 2016, we phased out grandfathered pricing and cancellations by members whose grandfathered pricing expired were not material. Our standard plan continues to be the most popular plan choice for new memberships.\n\nThe increase in domestic streaming cost of revenues was primarily due to a $335.4 million increase in content expenses relating to our existing and new streaming content, including more exclusive and original programming. In addition, we had a $33.2 million increase in other costs, such as payment processing fees and customer service call centers, due to our growing member base.\n\nDomestic marketing expenses\xa0increased\xa0primarily due to an increase in advertising and public relations spending as well as increased payments to our partners.\n\nOur Domestic streaming segment had a contribution margin of 36% for the year ended December\xa031, 2016, which increased as compared to the contribution margin of 33% for the year ended December\xa031, 2015 due to growth in paid memberships and revenue, which continued to outpace content and marketing spending.\n\nYear ended December 31, 2015 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2014\n\nThe increase in our domestic streaming revenues was due to a 17% growth in the average number of paid memberships and a 4% increase in average monthly revenue per paying membership resulting from our price changes and plan mix.\n\nThe increase in domestic streaming cost of revenues was primarily due to a $208.1 million increase in content expenses relating to our existing and new streaming content, including more exclusive and original programming.

We launched our streaming service in Canada in September 2010 and have expanded our services internationally as shown below.\n\n![timelineupdateda04.jpg](timelineupdateda04.jpg)\n\nYear ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2015\n\nThe increase in our international revenues was due to the 57% growth in the average number of paid international memberships and a\xa04%\xa0increase in average monthly revenue per paying membership. The average monthly revenue per paying membership for the fourth quarter of 2016 increased by 10% compared to the same quarter in prior year. These increases in average monthly revenue per paying membership were due to price changes and plan mix, offset partially by unfavorable fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. We estimate that international revenues would have been approximately $174 million higher in the year ended December 31, 2016 if foreign exchange rates had remained consistent with those for the year ended December 31, 2015. If foreign currency exchange rates fluctuate more than expected, revenues and average revenue per paying membership may differ from our expectations. Average paid international streaming memberships accounted for 43% of total average paid streaming memberships as of December\xa031, 2016, as compared to 35% of total average paid streaming memberships as of December\xa031, 2015.\n\nThe increase in international cost of revenues was primarily due to a $998.5 million increase in content expenses relating to our existing and new streaming content, including more exclusive and original programming. Other costs increased $132.5 million primarily due to increases in our streaming delivery expenses, costs associated with our customer service call centers and payment processing fees, all driven by our growing member base, partially offset by decreases resulting from exchange rate\n\n21', 'Table of Contents\n\nfluctuations.\n\nInternational marketing expenses increased mainly due to expenses for territories launched in the last eighteen months.\n\nInternational contribution losses decreased $24.9 million year over year due to growth in paid memberships and revenue, which outpaced the growth in marketing spending.\n\nYear ended December 31, 2015 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2014\n\nThe increase in our international revenues was due to the 66% growth in the average number of paid international memberships offset partially by a\xa010%\xa0decrease in average monthly revenue per paying membership. The decrease in average monthly revenue per paying membership was due to the impact of exchange rate fluctuations and to a lesser extent the impact of absorbing higher VAT rates across our European markets beginning January 1, 2015. These decreases were partially offset by our pricing changes and plan mix. We believe international revenues would have been approximately $331 million higher in 2015 if foreign exchange rates had remained consistent with those for the year ended December 31, 2014.\n\nThe increase in international cost of revenues was primarily due to a $522.1 million increase in content expenses primarily relating to expenses for territories launched in the last eighteen months, coupled with existing and new streaming content, including more exclusive and original programming. Other costs increased $104.2 million primarily due to increases in our streaming delivery expenses, costs associated with our customer service call centers and payment processing fees, all driven by our growing member base, partially offset by decreases resulting from exchange rate fluctuations. Average paid international streaming memberships accounted for 35% of total average paid streaming memberships as of December\xa031, 2015, as compared to 27% of total average paid streaming memberships as of December\xa031, 2014.\n\nInternational marketing expenses for the year ended December\xa031, 2015 increased as compared to the year ended December\xa031, 2014 mainly due to expenses for territories launched in the last eighteen months.\n\nInternational contribution losses increased $173.6 million year over year due to our increased spending for our international expansion and the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations.\n\nDomestic DVD Segment\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|  |  | As of/ Year Ended December 31, | | | | | | | | | | |  | Change | | | | | | | | | | | | |\n|  |  | 2016 | | |  | 2015 | | |  | 2014 | | |  | 2016 vs. 2015 | | | | | |  | 2015 vs. 2014 | | | | | |\n|  |  | (in thousands, except revenue per membership and percentages) | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |\n| Memberships: |  |  | | |  |  | | |  |  | | |  |  | | |  |  | |  |  | | |  |  | |\n| Net losses |  | (790 | | ) |  | (863 | | ) |  | (1,163 | | ) |  | (73 | | ) |  | (8 | )% |  | (300 | | ) |  | (26 | )% |\n| Memberships at end of period |  | 4,114 | |  |  | 4,904 | |  |  | 5,767 | |  |  | (790 | | ) |  | (16 | )% |  | (863 | | ) |  | (15 | )% |\n| Paid memberships at end of period |  | 4,029 | |  |  | 4,787 | |  |  | 5,668 | |  |  | (758 | | ) |  | (16 | )% |  | (881 | | ) |  | (16 | )% |\n| Average monthly revenue per paying membership |  | $10.22 | | |  | $10.30 | | |  | $10.29 | | |  | $(0.08) | | |  | (1 | )% |  | $0.01 | | |  | — | % |\n|  |  |  | | |  |  | | |  |  | | |  |  | | |  |  | |  |  | | |  |  | |\n| Contribution profit: |  |  | | |  |  | | |  |  | | |  |  | | |  |  | |  |  | | |  |  | |\n| Revenues |  | $ | 542,267 |  |  | $ | 645,737 |  |  | $ | 765,161 |  |  | $ | (103,470 | ) |  | (16 | )% |  | $ | (119,424 | ) |  | (16 | )% |\n| Cost of revenues |  | 262,742 | |  |  | 323,908 | |  |  | 396,882 | |  |  | (61,166 | | ) |  | (19 | )% |  | (72,974 | | ) |  | (18 | )% |\n| Contribution profit |  | 279,525 | |  |  | 321,829 | |  |  | 368,279 | |  |  | (42,304 | | ) |  | (13 | )% |  | (46,450 | | ) |  | (13 | )% |\n| Contribution margin |  | 52 | | % |  | 50 | | % |  | 48 | | % |  |  | | |  |  | |  |  | | |  |  | |\n\nYear ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2015\n\nIn the Domestic DVD segment, we derive revenues from our DVD-by-mail membership services.

In 2016, the difference between our 28% effective tax rate and the Federal statutory rate of 35% was $17.3 million primarily due to the 2016 Federal and California research and development (“R&D”) credits partially offset by state income taxes, foreign taxes, and nondeductible expenses.\n\nYear ended December 31, 2015 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2014\n\nThe decrease in our effective tax rate is mainly due to an increase in R&D credits and a decrease in state and local income taxes. In 2015, the difference between our 14% effective tax rate and the Federal statutory rate of 35% was $30.4 million primarily due to a $13.4 million release of tax reserves on previously unrecognized tax benefits as a result of an IRS audit settlement leading to the reassessment of our reserves for all open years, $16.5 million related to the retroactive reinstatement of the 2015 Federal R&D credit, as well as the California R&D credit; partially offset by state income taxes, foreign taxes and nondeductible expenses. On December 18, 2015, the Protecting Americans from Tax Hikes Act of 2015 (H.R. 2029) was signed into law which retroactively and permanently extended the Federal R&D credit from January 1, 2015. As a result, we recognized the retroactive benefit of the 2015 R&D credit as a discrete item in the fourth quarter of 2015, the period in which the legislation was enacted.\n\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\n\nCash, cash equivalents and short-term investments decreased $576.9 million from $2,310.7 million as of December\xa031, 2015 to $1,733.8 million as of December\xa031, 2016. In October 2016, we issued $1,000.0 million of long-term debt. The decrease in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments in the year ended December 31, 2016 was primarily driven by an increase in cash used in operations, partially offset by cash received from the issuance of debt. Long-term debt, net of debt issuance costs, was $3,364.3 million and $2,371.4 million as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. See Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.\n\nOur primary uses of cash include the acquisition, licensing and production of content, streaming delivery, marketing programs and personnel-related costs. Investments in original content, and in particular content that we produce and own, require more cash upfront relative to licensed content. We expect to significantly increase our investments in global streaming content, particularly in original content, which will impact our liquidity and may result in future negative free cash flows even after we achieve material global profitability.\n\nWe currently anticipate that cash flows from operations, together with available funds and access to financing sources, will continue to be sufficient to meet our cash needs for at least the next twelve months. Our ability to obtain any additional financing that we may choose to, or need to, obtain will depend on, among other things, our development efforts, business plans, operating performance, financial condition and the condition of the capital markets at the time we seek financing. We may not be able to obtain such financing on terms acceptable to us or at all. If we raise additional funds through the issuance of equity, equity-linked or debt securities, those securities may have rights, preferences or privileges senior to the rights of our common stock, and our stockholders may experience dilution.\n\nAs of December\xa031, 2016, cash and cash equivalents held by our foreign subsidiaries amounted to $278.5 million. If these funds are needed for our operations in the U.S., we would be required to accrue and pay U.S. income taxes and foreign withholding taxes on the portion associated with undistributed earnings for certain foreign subsidiaries.\n\nFree Cash Flow\n\nWe define free cash flow as cash provided by (used in) operating and investing activities excluding the non-operational cash flows from purchases, maturities and sales of short-term investments. We believe free cash flow is an important liquidity metric because it measures, during a given period, the amount of cash generated that is available to repay debt obligations, make investments in content and for certain other activities or the amount of cash used in operations, including investments in global streaming content. Free cash flow is considered a non-GAAP financial measure and should not be considered in isolation\n\n25', 'Table of Contents\n\nof, or as a substitute for, net income, operating income, cash flow (used in) provided by operating activities, or any other measure of financial performance or liquidity presented in accordance with GAAP.\n\nIn assessing liquidity in relation to our results of operations, we compare free cash flow to net income, noting that the three major recurring differences are excess content payments over expense, non-cash stock-based compensation expense and other working capital differences. The excess content payments over expense is variable based on the payment terms of our content agreements and is expected to increase as we enter into more agreements with upfront cash payments, such as licensing and production of original content. In the last 12 months, the ratio of content payments over content expense was 1.4. Working capital differences include deferred revenue, taxes and semi-annual interest payments on our outstanding debt. Our receivables from members generally settle quickly and deferred revenue is a source of cash flow.\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | | | | | | | | | | | |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|  | Year Ended December\xa031, | | | | | | | | | | |\n|  | 2016 | | |  | 2015 | | |  | 2014 | | |\n|  | (in thousands) | | | | | | | | | | |\n| Net cash (used in) provided by operating activities | $ | (1,473,984 | ) |  | $ | (749,439 | ) |  | $ | 16,483 |  |\n| Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities | 49,765 | |  |  | (179,192 | | ) |  | (42,866 | | ) |\n| Net cash provided by financing activities | 1,091,630 | |  |  | 1,640,277 | |  |  | 541,712 | |  |\n|  |  | | |  |  | | |  |  | | |\n| Non-GAAP free cash flow reconciliation: |  | | |  |  | | |  |  | | |\n| Net cash (used in) provided by operating activities | (1,473,984 | | ) |  | (749,439 | | ) |  | 16,483 | |  |\n| Acquisition of DVD content assets | (77,177 | | ) |  | (77,958 | | ) |  | (74,790 | | ) |\n| Purchases of property and equipment | (107,653 | | ) |  | (91,248 | | ) |  | (69,726 | | ) |\n| Other assets | (941 | | ) |  | (1,912 | | ) |  | 1,334 | |  |\n| Non-GAAP free cash flow | $ | (1,659,755 | ) |  | $ | (920,557 | ) |  | $ | (126,699 | ) |\n\nYear ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2015\n\nCash used in operating activities increased $724.5 million resulting in net cash used in operating activities of $1,474.0 million for the year ended December\xa031, 2016. The significant net cash used in operations is due primarily to the increase in investments in streaming content that require more upfront payments. The payments for streaming content assets increased $2,271.4 million, from $4,609.2 million to $6,880.6 million, or 49%. In addition, we had increased payments associated with higher operating expenses. The increased use of cash was partially offset by a $2,051.2 million or 30% increase in revenues.\n\nCash provided by investing activities increased $229.0 million, primarily due to an increase of $243.6 million in the proceeds from sales and maturities of short-term investments, net of purchases, partially offset by a $16.4 million increase in the purchases of property and equipment, primarily driven by the expansion of our Los Gatos, California headquarters, as well as our new office space in Los Angeles, California.\n\nCash provided by financing activities decreased $548.6 million primarily due to the $1,482.4 million net proceeds from the issuance of the 5.50% Notes and the 5.875% Notes in the year ended December\xa031, 2015 as compared to the $989.3 million net proceeds from the issuance of the 4.375% Notes in the year ended December\xa031, 2016.\n\nFree cash flow was $1,846.4 million lower than net income for the year ended December\xa031, 2016 primarily due to $2,092.1 million of cash payments for streaming content assets over streaming amortization expense partially offset by $173.7 million of non-cash stock-based compensation expense and $72.0 million of favorable other working capital differences.\n\nYear ended December 31, 2015 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2014\n\nCash provided by operating activities decreased $765.9 million resulting in net cash used in operating activities of $749.4 million for the year ended December\xa031, 2015. The significant net cash used in operations is due primarily to the increase in investments in streaming content that require more upfront payments. The payments for streaming assets increased $1,429.3 million, from $3,179.9 million to $4,609.2 million or 45%. In addition, we had increased payments associated with higher operating expenses. The increased use of cash was partially offset by a $1,274.9 million or 23% increase in revenues.\n\nCash used in investing activities increased $136.3 million, primarily due to a decrease of $108.4 million in the proceeds from sales and maturities of short-term investments, net of purchases. In addition, purchases of property and equipment increased by $21.5 million, primarily driven by the expansion of our Los Gatos, California headquarters.\n\n26', 'Table of Contents\n\nCash provided by financing activities increased $1,098.6 million primarily due to the $1,482.4 million net proceeds from the issuance of the 5.50% Notes and the 5.875% Notes in the year ended December\xa031, 2015 as compared to the $392.9 million net proceeds from the issuance of the 5.750% Notes in the year ended December\xa031, 2014.\n\nFree cash flow was $1,043.2 million lower than net income for the year ended December\xa031, 2015 primarily due to $1,203.9 million of cash payments for streaming content assets over streaming amortization expense partially offset by $124.7 million of non-cash stock-based compensation expense and $36.0 million of favorable other working capital differences.\n\nFree cash flow was $393.5 million lower than net income for the year ended December\xa031, 2014 primarily due to $523.6 million of cash payments for streaming content assets over streaming amortization expense partially offset by $115.2 million of non-cash stock-based compensation expense and $14.9 million of favorable other working capital differences.\n\nContractual Obligations\n\nFor the purpose of this table, contractual obligations for purchases of goods or services are defined as agreements that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. The expected timing of the payment of the obligations discussed below is estimated based on information available to us as of December\xa031, 2016. Timing of payments and actual amounts paid may be different depending on the time of receipt of goods or services or changes to agreed-upon amounts for some obligations.

An obligation for the production of content includes non-cancelable commitments under creative talent and employment agreements. An obligation for the acquisition and licensing of content is incurred at the time we enter into an agreement to obtain future titles. Once a title becomes available, a content liability is recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Certain agreements include the obligation to license rights for unknown future titles, the ultimate quantity and/or fees for which are not yet determinable as of the reporting date. Traditional film output deals, like the U.S. output deal with Disney, or certain TV series license agreements where the number of seasons to be aired is unknown, are examples of these types of agreements. The contractual obligations table above does not include any estimated obligation for the unknown future titles, payment for which could range from less than one year to more than five years. However, these unknown obligations are expected to be significant and we believe could include approximately $3 billion to $5 billion over the next three years, with the payments for the vast majority of such amounts expected to occur after the next twelve months. The foregoing range is based on considerable management judgments and the actual amounts may differ. Once we know the title that we will receive and the license fees, we include the amount in the contractual obligations table above.\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  |  |\n| (2) | Long-term debt obligations include our Notes consisting of principal and interest payments. See Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements for further details. |\n\n27', 'Table of Contents\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  |  |\n| (3) | Lease obligations include lease financing obligations of $18.5 million related to our current Los Gatos, California headquarters for which we are the deemed owner for accounting purposes, commitments of $530.2 million for our expanded headquarters in Los Gatos, California, and our new office space in Los Angeles, California and other commitments of $92.1 million for facilities under non-cancelable operating leases. These leases have expiration dates varying through approximately 2027. |\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  |  |\n| (4) | Other purchase obligations include all other non-cancelable contractual obligations. These contracts are primarily related to streaming delivery, DVD content acquisition, and miscellaneous open purchase orders for which we have not received the related services or goods. |\n\nAs of December\xa031, 2016, we had gross unrecognized tax benefits of $19.7 million which was classified in “Other non-current liabilities” and a reduction to deferred tax assets which was classified as "Other non-current assets" in the consolidated balance sheets. At this time, an estimate of the range of reasonably possible adjustments to the balance of unrecognized tax benefits cannot be made.\n\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\n\nWe do not have transactions with unconsolidated entities, such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities, whereby we have financial guarantees, subordinated retained interests, derivative instruments, or other contingent arrangements that expose us to material continuing risks, contingent liabilities, or any other obligation under a variable interest in an unconsolidated entity that provides financing, liquidity, market risk, or credit risk support to us.\n\nIndemnifications\n\nThe information set forth under Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements under the caption “Indemnification” is incorporated herein by reference.\n\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\n\nThe preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported periods. The Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") has defined a company’s critical accounting policies as the ones that are most important to the portrayal of a company’s financial condition and results of operations, and which require a company to make its most difficult and subjective judgments. Based on this definition, we have identified the critical accounting policies and judgments addressed below. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates.\n\nStreaming Content\n\nWe acquire, license and produce content, including original programing, in order to offer our members unlimited viewing of TV shows and films. The content licenses are for a fixed fee and specific windows of availability. Payment terms for certain content licenses and the production of content require more upfront cash payments relative to the amortization expense. Payments for content, including additions to streaming assets and the changes in related liabilities, are classified within "Net cash used in (provided by) operating activities" on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.\n\nFor licenses we capitalize the fee per title and record a corresponding liability at the gross amount of the liability when the license period begins, the cost of the title is known and the title is accepted and available for streaming. The portion available for streaming within one year is recognized as “Current content assets, net” and the remaining portion as “Non-current content assets, net” on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\n\nFor productions, we capitalize costs associated with the production, including development cost and direct costs. We include these amounts in "Non-current content assets, net" on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Participations and residuals are expensed in line with the amortization of production costs.\n\nBased on factors including historical and estimated viewing patterns, we amortize the content assets (licensed and produced) in “Cost of revenues” on the Consolidated Statements of Operations, over the shorter of each title\'s contractual window of availability or estimated period of use, beginning with the month of first availability. The amortization period typically ranges from six months to five years. For content where we expect more upfront viewing, for instance due to additional merchandising and marketing efforts, we amortize on an accelerated basis. We review factors that impact the\n\n28', 'Table of Contents\n\namortization of the content assets on a regular basis. Our estimates related to these factors require considerable management judgment. In the third quarter of 2016, we changed the amortization method of certain content given changes in estimated viewing patterns of this content. The effect of this change in estimate was a $19.8 million decrease in operating income and a $12.3 million decrease in net income for the year ended December 31, 2016. The effect on both basic and diluted earnings per share was a decrease of $0.03 for the year ended December 31, 2016. Changes in our estimates could have a significant impact on our future results of operations.\n\nOur business model is subscription based as opposed to a model generating revenues at a specific title level. Therefore, content assets, both licensed and produced, are reviewed in aggregate at the operating segment level when an event or change in circumstances indicates a change in the expected usefulness or that the fair value may be less than amortized cost. To date, we have not identified any such event or changes in circumstances. If such changes are identified in the future, these aggregated content assets will be stated at the lower of unamortized cost, net realizable value or fair value. In addition, unamortized costs for assets that have been, or are expected to be, abandoned are written off. No material write-down from unamortized cost was recorded in any of the periods presented.\n\nIncome Taxes\n\nWe record a provision for income taxes for the anticipated tax consequences of our reported results of operations using the asset and liability method. Deferred income taxes are recognized by applying enacted statutory tax rates applicable to future years to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases as well as net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. The measurement of deferred tax assets is reduced, if necessary, by a valuation allowance for any tax benefits for which future realization is uncertain. There was no significant valuation allowance as of December\xa031, 2016 or 2015.\n\nAlthough we believe our assumptions, judgments and estimates are reasonable, changes in tax laws or our interpretation of tax laws and the resolution of any tax audits could significantly impact the amounts provided for income taxes in our consolidated financial statements.\n\nIn evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets, in full or in part, we consider all available positive and negative evidence, including our past operating results, and our forecast of future earnings, future taxable income and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies. The assumptions utilized in determining future taxable income require significant judgment and are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying businesses. Actual operating results in future years could differ from our current assumptions, judgments and estimates. However, we believe that it is more likely than not that substantially all deferred tax assets recorded on our Consolidated Balance Sheets will ultimately be realized. In the event we were to determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets in the future, an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would be charged to earnings in the period in which we make such determination.\n\nWe did not recognize certain tax benefits from uncertain tax positions within the provision for income taxes. We may recognize a tax benefit only if it is more likely than not the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such positions are then measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon settlement. At December\xa031, 2016, our estimated gross unrecognized tax benefits were $19.7 million of which $17.0 million, if recognized, would favorably impact our future earnings. Due to uncertainties in any tax audit outcome, our estimates of the ultimate settlement of our unrecognized tax positions may change and the actual tax benefits may differ significantly from the estimates. See Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements for further information regarding income taxes.\n\nStock-Based Compensation\n\nWe grant fully vested non-qualified stock options to our employees on a monthly basis. As a result of immediate vesting, stock-based compensation expense is fully recognized on the grant date, and no estimate is required for post-vesting option forfeitures. Stock-based compensation expense at the grant date is based on the total number of options granted and an estimate of the fair value of the awards.\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  |  |\n| • | Expected Volatility: The Company calculates expected volatility based solely on implied volatility. We believe that implied volatility of publicly traded options in our common stock is more reflective of market conditions and, given consistently high trade volumes of the options, can reasonably be expected to be a better indicator of expected volatility than historical volatility of our common stock. An increase/decrease of 10% in our computation of expected volatility would increase/decrease the total stock-based compensation expense by approximately $14.4 million for the year ended December\xa031, 2016. |\n\n29', "Table of Contents\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  |  |\n| • | Suboptimal Exercise Factor:\xa0Our computation of the suboptimal exercise factor is based on historical and estimated option exercise behavior. An increase/decrease in the suboptimal exercise factor of 10% would increase/decrease the total stock-based compensation expense by approximately $6.0 million for the year ended December\xa031, 2016. |\n\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\n\nThe information set forth under Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements under the caption “Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” is incorporated herein by reference.\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  |  |\n| Item 7A. | Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk |\n\nWe are exposed to market risks related to interest rate changes and the corresponding changes in the market values of our investments, debt and foreign currency fluctuations.\n\nInterest Rate Risk\n\nThe primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal, while at the same time maximizing income we receive from investments without significantly increased risk. To achieve this objective, we follow an established investment policy and set of guidelines to monitor and help mitigate our exposure to interest rate and credit risk. The policy sets forth credit quality standards and limits our exposure to any one issuer, as well as our maximum exposure to various asset classes. We maintain a portfolio of cash equivalents and short-term investments in a variety of securities. These securities are classified as available-for-sale and are recorded at fair value with unrealized gains and losses, net of tax, included in “Accumulated other comprehensive loss” within Stockholders' equity in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\n\nFor the year ended December\xa031, 2016, we had no impairment charges associated with our short-term investment portfolio. Although we believe our current investment portfolio has very little risk of material impairment, we cannot predict future market conditions or market liquidity and can provide no assurance that our investment portfolio will remain materially unimpaired. Some of the securities we invest in may be subject to market risk due to changes in prevailing interest rates which may cause the principal amount of the investment to fluctuate. For example, if we hold a security that was issued with a fixed interest rate at the then-prevailing rate and the prevailing interest rate later rises, the value of our investment will decline. At December\xa031, 2016, our cash equivalents were generally invested in money market funds, which are not subject to market risk because the interest paid on such funds fluctuates with the prevailing interest rate. Our short-term investments were comprised of corporate debt securities, government and agency securities and asset backed securities.\n\nChanges in interest rates could adversely affect the market value of the securities we hold that are classified as short-term investments. The table below separates these investments, based on stated maturities, to show the approximate exposure to interest rates as of December\xa031, 2016.\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | | | | |\n|  |  |  |  |  |\n|  |  | (in\xa0thousands) | | |\n| Due within one year |  | $ | 61,833 |  |\n| Due after one year and through 5 years |  | 204,373 | |  |\n| Total |  | $ | 266,206 |  |\n\nA sensitivity analysis was performed on our investment portfolio as of December\xa031, 2016. The analysis is based on an estimate of the hypothetical changes in market value of the portfolio that would result from an immediate parallel shift in the yield curve of various magnitudes. This methodology\xa0assumes a more immediate change in interest rates to reflect the current economic environment.\n\nThe following table presents the hypothetical fair values of our debt securities classified as short-term investments assuming immediate parallel shifts in the yield curve of 50 basis points (“BPS”), 100 BPS and 150 BPS. The analysis is shown as of December\xa031, 2016:\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| Fair Value as of December\xa031, 2016  (in thousands) | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |\n| -150\xa0BPS | | |  | -100 BPS | | |  | -50 BPS | | |  | +50 BPS | | |  | +100\xa0BPS | | |  | +150\xa0BPS | | |\n| $ | 271,745 |  |  | $ | 270,151 |  |  | $ | 268,180 |  |  | $ | 264,234 |  |  | $ | 262,261 |  |  | $ | 260,289 |  |\n\n30", 'Table of Contents\n\nBased on investment positions as of December\xa031, 2016, a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates across all maturities would result in a $3.9 million incremental decline in the fair market value of the portfolio. As of December\xa031, 2015, a similar 100 basis point increase in the yield curve would have resulted in a $6.6 million incremental decline in the fair market value of the portfolio. Such losses would only be realized if the Company sold the investments prior to maturity.\n\nAs of December\xa031, 2016, we had $3.4 billion of debt, consisting of fixed rate unsecured debt in five tranches. Refer to Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements for details about all issuances. The fair value of our debt will fluctuate with movements of interest rates, increasing in periods of declining rates of interest and declining in periods of increasing rates of interest.\n\nForeign Currency Risk\n\nInternational revenues and cost of revenues account for 36% and 48%, respectively, of consolidated amounts for the year ended December\xa031, 2016. The majority of international revenues and a smaller portion of expenses are denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar and we therefore have foreign currency risk related to these currencies, which are primarily the euro, the British pound, the Canadian dollar, the Australian dollar and the Brazilian real.\n\nAccordingly, changes in exchange rates, and in particular a weakening of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar may negatively affect our revenue and contribution profit (loss) of our International streaming segment as expressed in U.S. dollars. For the year ended December\xa031, 2016, we believe our international revenues would have been approximately $174.4 million higher had foreign currency exchange rates remained consistent with those for the year ended December\xa031, 2015.\n\nWe have also experienced and will continue to experience fluctuations in our net income as a result of gains (losses) on the settlement and the remeasurement of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies that are not the functional currency. In the year ended December\xa031, 2016, we recognized a $22.8 million foreign exchange gain which resulted primarily from the remeasurement of significant content liabilities denominated in currencies other than functional currencies.\n\nWe do not use foreign exchange contracts or derivatives to hedge any foreign currency exposures. The volatility of exchange rates depends on many factors that we cannot forecast with reliable accuracy. Our continued international expansion increases our exposure to exchange rate fluctuations and as a result such fluctuations could have a significant impact on our future results of operations.\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  |  |\n| Item 8. | Financial Statements and Supplementary Data |\n\nThe consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes listed in Part IV, Item\xa015(a)(1) of this Annual Report on Form 10-K are included immediately following Part IV hereof and incorporated by reference herein.\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  |  |\n| Item 9. | Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure |\n\nNone.\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  |  |\n| Item 9A. | Controls and Procedures |\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  |  |\n| (a) | Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures |\n\nOur management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K were effective in providing reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission’s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures.\n\nOur management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal controls will prevent all error and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within Netflix have been detected.\n\n31', 'Table of Contents\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  |  |\n| (b) | Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting |\n\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as amended (the Exchange Act)).

Netflix, Inc.’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.\n\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\n\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\n\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n\nIn our opinion, Netflix, Inc. maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December\xa031, 2016, based on the COSO criteria.\n\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheets of Netflix, Inc. as of December\xa031, 2016 and 2015, and the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, stockholders’ equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December\xa031, 2016 of Netflix, Inc. and our report dated January\xa027, 2017 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  | |\n|  |  |\n|  | /s/ Ernst & Young LLP |\n| San Jose, California |  |\n| January 27, 2017 |  |\n\n33', 'Table of Contents\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  |  |\n| Item 9B. | Other Information |\n\nNone.\n\n34', 'Table of Contents\n\nPART III\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  |  |\n| Item 10. | Directors, Executive Officers and Corporate Governance |\n\nInformation regarding our directors and executive officers is incorporated by reference from the information contained under the sections “Proposal One: Election of Directors,” “Section 16(a) Beneficial Ownership Compliance” and “Code of Ethics” in our Proxy Statement for the Annual Meeting of Stockholders.\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  |  |\n| Item 11. | Executive Compensation |\n\nInformation required by this item is incorporated by reference from information contained under the section “Compensation of Executive Officers and Other Matters” in our Proxy Statement for the Annual Meeting of Stockholders.\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  |  |\n| Item 12. | Security Ownership of Certain Beneficial Owners and Management and Related Stockholder Matters |\n\nInformation required by this item is incorporated by reference from information contained under the sections “Security Ownership of Certain Beneficial Owners and Management” and “Equity Compensation Plan Information” in our Proxy Statement for the Annual Meeting of Stockholders.\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  |  |\n| Item 13. | Certain Relationships and Related Transactions, and Director Independence |\n\nInformation required by this item is incorporated by reference from information contained under the section “Certain Relationships and Related Transactions” and “Director Independence” in our Proxy Statement for the Annual Meeting of Stockholders.\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  |  |\n| Item 14. | Principal Accounting Fees and Services |\n\nInformation with respect to principal independent registered public accounting firm fees and services is incorporated by reference from the information under the caption “Proposal Two: Ratification of Appointment of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm” in our Proxy Statement for the Annual Meeting of Stockholders.\n\n35', 'Table of Contents\n\nPART IV\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  |  |\n| Item 15. | Exhibits, Financial Statement Schedules |\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  |  |\n| (a) | The following documents are filed as part of this Annual Report on Form 10-K: |\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  |  |\n| (1) | Financial Statements: |\n\nThe financial statements are filed as part of this Annual Report on Form 10-K under “Item 8.

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies |\n\nDescription of Business\n\nNetflix, Inc. (the “Company”) was incorporated on August\xa029, 1997 and began operations on April\xa014, 1998. The Company is the world’s leading internet television network with over 93 million streaming members in over 190 countries enjoying more than 125 million hours of hours of TV shows and movies per day, including original series, documentaries and feature films. Members can watch as much as they want, anytime, anywhere, on nearly any internet-connected screen. Members can play, pause and resume watching, all without commercials or commitments. Additionally, in the United States ("U.S."), members can receive DVDs.\n\nThe Company has three reportable segments, Domestic streaming, International streaming and Domestic DVD. A majority of the Company’s revenues are generated in the United States, and substantially all of the Company’s long-lived tangible assets are held in the United States. The Company’s revenues are derived from monthly membership fees.\n\nBasis of Presentation\n\nThe consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. Intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated.\n\nUse of Estimates\n\nThe preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Significant items subject to such estimates and assumptions include the amortization policy for the streaming content assets; the recognition and measurement of income tax assets and liabilities; and the valuation of stock-based compensation. The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that the Company believes to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates.\n\nAccounting Guidance Not Yet Adopted\n\nIn May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) which amended the existing accounting standards for revenue recognition. ASU 2014-09 establishes principles for recognizing revenue upon the transfer of promised goods or services to customers, in an amount that reflects the expected consideration received in exchange for those goods or services. In July 2015, the FASB deferred the effective date for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017 (including interim reporting periods within those periods). Early adoption is permitted to the original effective date for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016 (including interim reporting periods within those periods). The amendments may be applied retrospectively to each prior period (full retrospective) or retrospectively with the cumulative effect recognized as of the date of initial application (modified retrospective). The Company will adopt ASU 2014-09 in the first quarter of 2018 and apply the full retrospective approach. The Company does not expect the impact on its consolidated financial statements to be material.\n\nIn February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842) in order to increase transparency and comparability among organizations by recognizing lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet for those leases classified as operating leases under previous GAAP. ASU 2016-02 requires that a lessee should recognize a liability to make lease payments (the lease liability) and a right-of-use asset representing its right to use the underlying asset for the lease term on the balance sheet. ASU 2016-02 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018 (including interim periods within those periods) using a modified retrospective approach and early adoption is permitted. The Company will adopt ASU 2016-02 in the first quarter of 2019 and is currently in the process of evaluating the impact of adoption of the ASU on its consolidated financial statements.\n\nIn March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09, Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting, which amends Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") Topic 718,\xa0Compensation – Stock Compensation. \xa0ASU 2016-09 simplifies several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment transactions, including the income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, and classification on the statement of cash flows. ASU 2016-09\xa0is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company will adopt ASU 2016-09 in the first quarter of 2017. The Company is unable to estimate the impact of adoption as it is dependent\n\n45', 'Table of Contents\n\nupon future stock option exercises which can not be predicted. However, the Company is expecting the adoption of the ASU to have a material impact on net income, basic and diluted earnings per share, deferred tax assets and net cash from operations and the effective tax rate may be reduced.\n\nIn November 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-18, Restricted Cash, which requires amounts generally described as restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents be included with cash and cash equivalents when reconciling the total beginning and ending amounts for the periods shown on the statement of cash flows. ASU 2016-08 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018 (including interim periods within those periods) using a retrospective transition method to each period presented. The Company does not expect the impact on its consolidated financial statements to be material.\n\nCash Equivalents and Short-term Investments\n\nThe Company considers investments in instruments purchased with an original maturity of 90 days or less to be cash equivalents. The Company also classifies amounts in transit from payment processors for customer credit card and debit card transactions as cash equivalents.\n\nThe Company classifies short-term investments, which consist of marketable securities with original maturities in excess of 90 days as available-for-sale. Short-term investments are reported at fair value with unrealized gains and losses included in “Accumulated other comprehensive loss” within Stockholders’ equity in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The amortization of premiums and discounts on the investments, realized gains and losses, and declines in value judged to be other-than-temporary on available-for-sale securities are included in “Interest and other income (expense)” in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The Company uses the specific identification method to determine cost in calculating realized gains and losses upon the sale of short-term investments.\n\nShort-term investments are reviewed periodically to identify possible other-than-temporary impairment. When evaluating the investments, the Company reviews factors such as the length of time and extent to which fair value has been below cost basis, the financial condition of the issuer, the Company’s intent to sell, or whether it would be more likely than not that the Company would be required to sell the investments before the recovery of their amortized cost basis.\n\nStreaming Content\n\nThe Company acquires, licenses and produces content, including original programming, in order to offer members unlimited viewing of TV shows and films. The content licenses are for a fixed fee and specific windows of availability. Payment terms for certain content licenses and the production of content require more upfront cash payments relative to the amortization expense. Payments for content, including additions to streaming assets and the changes in related liabilities, are classified within "Net cash (used in) provided by operating activities" on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.\n\nFor licenses, the Company capitalizes the fee per title and records a corresponding liability at the gross amount of the liability when the license period begins, the cost of the title is known and the title is accepted and available for streaming. The portion available for streaming within one year is recognized as “Current content assets, net” and the remaining portion as “Non-current content assets, net” on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\n\nFor productions, the Company capitalizes costs associated with the production, including development costs and direct costs. These amounts are included in "Non-current content assets, net" on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Participations and residuals are expensed in line with the amortization of production costs.\n\nBased on factors including historical and estimated viewing patterns, the Company amortizes the content assets (licensed and produced) in “Cost of revenues” on the Consolidated Statements of Operations over the shorter of each title\'s contractual window of availability or estimated period of use, beginning with the month of first availability. The amortization period typically ranges from six months to five years. For content where the Company expects more upfront viewing, for instance due to additional merchandising and marketing efforts, the amortization is on an accelerated basis. The Company reviews factors impacting the amortization of the content assets on a regular basis. The Company\'s estimates related to these factors require considerable management judgment.\xa0 In the third quarter of 2016, the Company changed the amortization method of certain content given changes in estimated viewing patterns of this content. The effect of this change in estimate was a $19.8 million decrease in operating income and a $12.3 million decrease in net income for the year ended December\xa031, 2016. The effect on both basic earnings per share and diluted earnings per share was a decrease of $0.03 for the year ended December\xa031, 2016. Changes in estimates could have a significant impact on the Company\'s future results of operations.\n\nThe Company\'s business model is subscription based as opposed to a model generating revenues at a specific title level. Therefore, content assets, both licensed and produced are reviewed in aggregate at the operating segment level when an event or change in circumstances indicates a change in the expected usefulness of the content or that the fair value may be less than amortized cost. To date, we have not identified any such event or changes in circumstances. If such changes are identified in the future, these aggregated content assets will be stated at the lower of unamortized cost, net realizable value or fair value. In\n\n46', 'Table of Contents\n\naddition, unamortized costs for assets that have been, or are expected to be, abandoned are written off. No material write-down from unamortized cost was recorded in any of the periods presented.\n\nThe Company has entered into certain licenses with collective management organizations, and are currently involved in negotiations with others who hold certain rights to music and other entertainment works "publicly performed" in connection with streaming content into various territories. Accruals for estimated license fees are recorded and then adjusted based on any changes in estimates. These amounts are included in the streaming content obligations. The results of these negotiations are uncertain and may be materially different from management\'s estimates.\n\nDVD Content\n\nThe Company acquires DVD content for the purpose of renting such content to its domestic DVD members and earning membership rental revenues, and, as such, the Company considers its direct purchase DVD assets to be a productive asset. Accordingly, the Company classifies its DVD assets in “Non-current content assets, net” on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The acquisition of DVD content assets, net of changes in related liabilities, is classified within "Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities" on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows because the DVD content assets are considered a productive asset. Other companies in the in-home entertainment video industry classify these cash flows as operating activities. The Company amortizes its direct purchase DVDs on an accelerated basis over their estimated useful lives, which range from one year to two years. The Company also obtains DVD content through revenue sharing agreements with studios and other content providers. Revenue sharing obligations are expensed as incurred based on shipments.\n\nProperty and Equipment\n\nProperty and equipment are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method over the shorter of the estimated useful lives of the respective assets, generally up to 30 years, or the lease term for leasehold improvements, if applicable. Leased buildings are capitalized and included in property and equipment when the Company was involved in the construction funding and did not meet the “sale-leaseback” criteria.\n\nRevenue Recognition\n\nRevenues are recognized ratably over each monthly membership period. Revenues are presented net of the taxes that are collected from members and remitted to governmental authorities. Deferred revenue consists of membership fees billed that have not been recognized and gift and other prepaid memberships that have not been redeemed.\n\nMarketing\n\nMarketing expenses consist primarily of advertising expenses and payments made to the Company’s partners, including device partners, MVPD\'s, mobile platforms and ISP\'s. Advertising expenses include promotional activities such as digital and television advertising. Advertising costs are expensed as incurred. Advertising expenses were $842.4 million, $714.3 million and $533.1 million for the years ended December\xa031, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.\n\nResearch and Development\n\nResearch and development expenses are included within "Technology and Development" on the Company\'s Consolidated Statements of Operations and primarily consist of payroll and related costs incurred in making improvements to our service offerings. Research and development expenses were $768.3 million, $570.0 million and $398.2 million for the years ended December\xa031, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.\n\nIncome Taxes\n\nThe Company records a provision for income taxes for the anticipated tax consequences of the reported results of operations using the asset and liability method. Deferred income taxes are recognized by applying enacted statutory tax rates applicable to future years to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases as well as net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. The measurement of deferred tax assets is reduced, if necessary, by a valuation allowance for any tax benefits for which future realization is uncertain. There was no significant valuation allowance as of December 31, 2016 or 2015.\n\nThe Company did not recognize certain tax benefits from uncertain tax positions within the provision for income taxes. The Company may recognize a tax benefit only if it is more likely than not the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such positions are then measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon\n\n47', 'Table of Contents\n\nsettlement. The Company recognizes interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions in income tax expense. See Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements for further information regarding income taxes.\n\nForeign Currency\n\nThe functional currency for the Company\'s subsidiaries is determined based on the primary economic environment in which the subsidiary operates. The Company translates the assets and liabilities of its non-U.S. dollar functional currency subsidiaries into U.S. dollars using exchange rates in effect at the end of each period. Revenues and expenses for these subsidiaries are translated using rates that approximate those in effect during the period. Gains and losses from these translations are recognized in cumulative translation adjustment included in "Accumulated other comprehensive loss" in Stockholders’ equity on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\n\nPrior to January 1, 2015, the functional currency of certain of the Company\'s European entities was the British pound. The Company changed the functional currency of these entities to the euro effective January 1, 2015 following the redomiciliation of the European headquarters and the launch of the Netflix service in several significant European countries. The change in functional currency was applied prospectively from January 1, 2015. Monetary assets and liabilities have been remeasured to the euro at current exchange rates. Non-monetary assets and liabilities have been remeasured to the euro using the exchange rate effective for the period in which the balance arose. As a result of this change of functional currency, the Company recorded a $21.8 million cumulative translation adjustment included in other comprehensive loss for year ended December 31, 2015.\n\nThe Company remeasures monetary assets and liabilities that are not denominated in the functional currency at exchange rates in effect at the end of each period. Gains and losses from these remeasurements are recognized in interest and other income (expense). Foreign currency transactions resulted in a gain of $22.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 and losses of $37.3 million and $8.2 million for the years ended December\xa031, 2015 and 2014 respectively.\n\nEarnings Per Share\n\nIn June 2015, the Company\'s Board of Directors declared a seven-for-one stock split in the form of a stock dividend that was paid on\xa0July 14, 2015\xa0to all shareholders of record as of\xa0July 2, 2015 ("Stock Split").\n\nOutstanding share and per-share amounts disclosed for all periods provided have been retroactively adjusted to reflect the effects of the Stock Split.\n\nBasic earnings per share is computed using the weighted-average number of outstanding shares of common stock during the period. Diluted earnings per share is computed using the weighted-average number of outstanding shares of common stock and, when dilutive, potential common shares outstanding during the period. Potential common shares consist of incremental shares issuable upon the assumed exercise of stock options. The computation of earnings per share is as follows:\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | | | | | | | | | | | |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|  | Year ended December\xa031, | | | | | | | | | | |\n|  | 2016 | | |  | 2015 | | |  | 2014 | | |\n|  | (in\xa0thousands,\xa0except\xa0per\xa0share\xa0data) | | | | | | | | | | |\n| Basic earnings per share: |  | | |  |  | | |  |  | | |\n| Net income | $ | 186,678 |  |  | $ | 122,641 |  |  | $ | 266,799 |  |\n| Shares used in computation: |  | | |  |  | | |  |  | | |\n| Weighted-average common shares outstanding | 428,822 | |  |  | 425,889 | |  |  | 420,544 | |  |\n| Basic earnings per share | $ | 0.44 |  |  | $ | 0.29 |  |  | $ | 0.63 |  |\n| Diluted earnings per share: |  | | |  |  | | |  |  | | |\n| Net income | $ | 186,678 |  |  | $ | 122,641 |  |  | $ | 266,799 |  |\n| Shares used in computation: |  | | |  |  | | |  |  | | |\n| Weighted-average common shares outstanding | 428,822 | |  |  | 425,889 | |  |  | 420,544 | |  |\n| Employee stock options | 9,830 | |  |  | 10,567 | |  |  | 11,350 | |  |\n| Weighted-average number of shares | 438,652 | |  |  | 436,456 | |  |  | 431,894 | |  |\n| Diluted earnings per share | $ | 0.43 |  |  | $ | 0.28 |  |  | $ | 0.62 |  |\n\nEmployee stock options with exercise prices greater than the average market price of the common stock were excluded from the diluted calculation as their inclusion would have been anti-dilutive. The following table summarizes the potential common shares excluded from the diluted calculation:\n\n48', 'Table of Contents\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | | | | | | | | |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|  | Year\xa0ended\xa0December\xa031, | | | | | | | |\n|  | 2016 | |  | 2015 | |  | 2014 | |\n|  | (in thousands) | | | | | | | |\n| Employee stock options | 1,545 |  |  | 517 |  |  | 917 |  |\n\nStock-Based Compensation\n\nThe Company grants fully vested non-qualified stock options to its employees on a monthly basis. As a result of immediate vesting, stock-based compensation expense is fully recognized on the grant date, and no estimate is required for post-vesting option forfeitures. See Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements for further information regarding stock-based compensation.\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  |  |\n| 2. | Short-term Investments |\n\nThe Company’s investment policy is consistent with the definition of available-for-sale securities. The Company does not buy and hold securities principally for the purpose of selling them in the near future. The Company’s policy is focused on the preservation of capital, liquidity and return. From time to time, the Company may sell certain securities but the objectives are generally not to generate profits on short-term differences in price.

The hierarchy level assigned to each security in the Company’s available-for-sale\n\n49', 'Table of Contents\n\nportfolio and cash equivalents is based on its assessment of the transparency and reliability of the inputs used in the valuation of such instrument at the measurement date. The fair value of available-for-sale securities and cash equivalents included in the Level 1 category is based on quoted prices that are readily and regularly available in an active market. The fair value of available-for-sale securities included in the Level 2 category is based on observable inputs, such as quoted prices for similar assets at the measurement date; quoted prices in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable, either directly or indirectly. These values were obtained from an independent pricing service and were evaluated using pricing models that vary by asset class and may incorporate available trade, bid and other market information and price quotes from well-established independent pricing vendors and broker-dealers. The Company’s procedures include controls to ensure that appropriate fair values are recorded, such as comparing prices obtained from multiple independent sources. See Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements for further information regarding the fair value of the Company’s senior notes.\n\nBecause the Company does not intend to sell the investments that are in an unrealized loss position and it is not likely that the Company will be required to sell any investments before recovery of their amortized cost basis, the Company does not consider those investments with an unrealized loss to be other-than-temporarily impaired at December\xa031, 2016. There were no material other-than-temporary impairments or credit losses related to available-for-sale securities in the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 or 2014.\n\nThere were no material gross realized gains or losses from the sale of available-for-sale investments in the years ended December\xa031, 2016, 2015 and 2014. Realized gains and losses and interest income are included in "Interest and other income (expense)" on the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\n\nThe estimated fair value of short-term investments by contractual maturity as of December\xa031, 2016 is as follows:\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | | | | |\n|  |  |  |  |  |\n|  |  | (in\xa0thousands) | | |\n| Due within one year |  | $ | 61,833 |  |\n| Due after one year and through 5 years |  | 204,373 | |  |\n| Total short-term investments |  | $ | 266,206 |  |\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  |  |\n| 3. | Balance Sheet Components |\n\nContent Assets\n\nContent assets consisted of the following:\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | | | | | | | |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|  | As of December 31, | | | | | | |\n|  | 2016 | | |  | 2015 | | |\n|  | (in thousands) | | | | | | |\n|  |  | | |  |  | | |\n| Licensed content, net | $ | 9,595,315 |  |  | $ | 6,827,119 |  |\n|  |  | | |  |  | | |\n| Produced content, net |  | | |  |  | | |\n| Released, less amortization | 335,400 | |  |  | 61,515 | |  |\n| In production | 1,010,463 | |  |  | 279,013 | |  |\n| In development | 34,215 | |  |  | 24,651 | |  |\n|  | 1,380,078 | |  |  | 365,179 | |  |\n| DVD, net | 25,415 | |  |  | 26,517 | |  |\n| Total | $ | 11,000,808 |  |  | $ | 7,218,815 |  |\n|  |  | | |  |  | | |\n| Current content assets, net | $ | 3,726,307 |  |  | $ | 2,905,998 |  |\n| Non-current content assets, net | $ | 7,274,501 |  |  | $ | 4,312,817 |  |\n\nProduced content is included in "Non-current content assets, net" on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

Obligations that are in non-U.S. dollar currencies are translated to U.S. dollar at period end rates. An obligation for the production of content includes non-cancelable commitments under creative talent and employment agreements. An obligation for the acquisition and licensing of content is incurred at the time the Company enters into an agreement to obtain future titles. Once a title becomes available, a content liability is generally recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Certain agreements include the obligation to license rights for unknown future titles, the ultimate quantity and/or fees for which are not yet determinable as of the reporting date. Traditional film output deals, like the U.S. output deal with Disney, or certain TV series license agreements where the number of seasons to be aired is unknown, are examples of such license agreements. The Company does not include any estimated obligation for these future titles beyond the known minimum amount. However, the unknown obligations are expected to be significant.\n\nLease obligations\n\nThe Company leases facilities under non-cancelable operating leases with various expiration dates through 2027. Several lease agreements contain rent escalation clauses or rent holidays. For purposes of recognizing minimum rental expenses on a straight-line basis over the terms of the leases, the Company uses the date of initial possession to begin amortization, which is generally when the Company enters the space and begins to make improvements in preparation for intended use. For scheduled rent escalation clauses during the lease terms or for rental payments commencing at a date other than the date of initial occupancy, the Company records minimum rental expenses on a straight-line basis over the terms of the leases in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The Company has the option to extend or renew most of its leases which may increase the future minimum lease commitments.\n\nBecause the terms of the Company’s facilities lease agreements for its original Los Gatos, California headquarters site required the Company’s involvement in the construction funding of the buildings, the Company is the “deemed owner” (for accounting purposes only) of these buildings. Accordingly, the Company recorded an asset of $40.7 million, representing the total costs of the buildings and improvements, including the costs paid by the lessor (the legal owner of the buildings), with corresponding liabilities. Upon completion of construction of each building, the Company did not meet the sale-leaseback criteria for de-recognition of the building assets and liabilities. Therefore the leases are accounted for as financing obligations. At December\xa031, 2016, the lease financing obligation balance was $29.2 million, the majority of which is recorded in “Other non-current liabilities,” on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The remaining future minimum payments under the lease financing obligation are $18.5 million. The lease financing obligation balance at the end of the lease term will be approximately $21.8 million which approximates the net book value of the buildings to be relinquished to the lessor.\n\nIn addition to the lease financing obligation, future minimum lease payments include $530.2 million as of December\xa031, 2016 related to non-cancelable operating leases for the expanded headquarters in Los Gatos, California and the new office space in Los Angeles, California.\n\n52', "Table of Contents\n\nFuture minimum payments under lease financing obligations and non-cancelable operating leases as of December\xa031, 2016 are as follows:\n\n|  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | | | |\n|  |  |  |  |\n| Year Ending December\xa031, | Future  Minimum  Payments | | |\n|  | (in\xa0thousands) | | |\n| 2017 | $ | 64,502 |  |\n| 2018 | 76,310 | |  |\n| 2019 | 68,456 | |  |\n| 2020 | 66,603 | |  |\n| 2021 | 57,434 | |  |\n| Thereafter | 307,535 | |  |\n| Total minimum payments | $ | 640,840 |  |\n\nRent expense associated with the operating leases was $53.1 million, $34.7 million and $26.6 million for the years ended December\xa031, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.\n\nLegal Proceedings\n\nFrom time to time, in the normal course of its operations, the Company is subject to litigation matters and claims, including claims relating to employee relations, business practices and patent infringement. Litigation can be expensive and disruptive to normal business operations. Moreover, the results of complex legal proceedings are difficult to predict and the Company's view of these matters may change in the future as the litigation and events related thereto unfold. The Company expenses legal fees as incurred. The Company records a provision for contingent losses when it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. An unfavorable outcome to any legal matter, if material, could have an adverse effect on the Company's operations or its financial position, liquidity or results of operations.\n\nThe Company is involved in litigation matters not listed herein but does not consider the matters to be material either individually or in the aggregate at this time. The Company's view of the matters not listed may change in the future as the litigation and events related thereto unfold.\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  |  |\n| 6. | Guarantees—Indemnification Obligations |\n\nIn the ordinary course of business, the Company has entered into contractual arrangements under which it has agreed to provide indemnification of varying scope and terms to business partners and other parties with respect to certain matters, including, but not limited to, losses arising out of the Company’s breach of such agreements and out of intellectual property infringement claims made by third parties. In these circumstances, payment may be conditional on the other party making a claim pursuant to the procedures specified in the particular contract.\n\nThe Company’s obligations under these agreements may be limited in terms of time or amount, and in some instances, the Company may have recourse against third parties for certain payments. In addition, the Company has entered into indemnification agreements with its directors and certain of its officers that will require it, among other things, to indemnify them against certain liabilities that may arise by reason of their status or service as directors or officers. The terms of such obligations vary.\n\nIt is not possible to make a reasonable estimate of the maximum potential amount of future payments under these or similar agreements due to the conditional nature of the Company’s obligations and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular agreement. No amount has been accrued in the accompanying financial statements with respect to these indemnification guarantees.\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  |  |\n| 7. | Stockholders’ Equity |\n\n53", "Table of Contents\n\nStock Split\n\nIn March 2015, the Company's Board of Directors adopted an amendment to the Company's Certificate of Incorporation, to increase the number of shares of capital stock the Company is authorized to issue from 170,000,000 (160,000,000 shares of common stock and 10,000,000 shares of preferred stock), par value $0.001 to 5,000,000,000 (4,990,000,000 shares of common stock and 10,000,000 shares of preferred stock), par value $0.001.

The 2011 Stock Plan provides for the grant of incentive stock options to employees and for the grant of non-statutory stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock and restricted stock units to employees, directors and consultants. As of December\xa031, 2016, 13.3 million shares were reserved for future grants under the 2011 Stock Plan.\n\nA summary of the activities related to the Company’s stock option plans, as adjusted for the Stock Split, is as follows:\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|  | Shares\xa0Available  for Grant | |  | Options Outstanding | | | | | |  | Weighted- Average Remaining Contractual Term (in\xa0Years) |  | Aggregate  Intrinsic\xa0Value  (in\xa0Thousands) | | |\n|  | Number of  Shares | |  | Weighted- Average Exercise Price  (per Share) | | |  |\n| Balances as of December 31, 2013 | 23,844,219 |  |  | 24,688,286 |  |  | $ | 13.61 |  |  |  |  |  | | |\n| Granted | (3,819,011 | ) |  | 3,819,011 |  |  | 57.55 | |  |  |  |  |  | | |\n| Exercised | — |  |  | (5,661,880 | ) |  | 10.81 | |  |  |  |  |  | | |\n| Balances as of December 31, 2014 | 20,025,208 |  |  | 22,845,417 |  |  | $ | 21.65 |  |  |  |  |  | | |\n| Granted | (3,179,892 | ) |  | 3,179,892 |  |  | 82.67 | |  |  |  |  |  | | |\n| Exercised |  | |  | (5,029,553 | ) |  | 15.38 | |  |  |  |  |  | | |\n| Balances as of December 31, 2015 | 16,845,316 |  |  | 20,995,756 |  |  | $ | 32.39 |  |  |  |  |  | | |\n| Granted | (3,555,363 | ) |  | 3,555,363 |  |  | 102.03 | |  |  |  |  |  | | |\n| Exercised | — |  |  | (2,113,772 | ) |  | 17.48 | |  |  |  |  |  | | |\n| Balances as of December 31, 2016 | 13,289,953 |  |  | 22,437,347 |  |  | $ | 44.83 |  |  | 6.18 |  | $ | 1,772,185 |  |\n| Vested and exercisable at  December\xa031, 2016 |  | |  | 22,437,347 |  |  | $ | 44.83 |  |  | 6.18 |  | $ | 1,772,185 |  |\n\nThe aggregate intrinsic value in the table above represents the total pretax intrinsic value (the difference between the Company’s closing stock price on the last trading day of 2016 and the exercise price, multiplied by the number of in-the-money options) that would have been received by the option holders had all option holders exercised their options on the last trading day of 2016. This amount changes based on the fair market value of the Company’s common stock. Total intrinsic value of options exercised for the years ended December\xa031, 2016, 2015 and 2014 was $189.2 million, $368.4 million and $265.1 million, respectively.\n\nCash received from option exercises for the years ended December\xa031, 2016, 2015 and 2014 was $37.0 million, $78.0 million and $60.5 million, respectively.\n\n54", "Table of Contents\n\nStock-Based Compensation\n\nStock options granted are exercisable for the full ten year contractual term regardless of employment status.

Prior to January 1, 2015, the Company bifurcated its option grants into two employee groupings (executive and non-executive) to determine the suboptimal exercise factor. Beginning on January 1, 2015, the Company began aggregating employee groupings for its determination of the suboptimal exercise factor as the previous bifurcation into two groupings did not have a material impact on the fair value of the options granted.\n\nPrior to January 1, 2015, the Company's computation of expected volatility was based on a blend of historical volatility of its common stock and implied volatility of tradable forward call options to purchase shares of its common stock, as low trade volume of its tradable forward call options prior to 2011 precluded sole reliance on implied volatility. Beginning on January 1, 2015, expected volatility is based solely on implied volatility. The Company believes that implied volatility of publicly traded options in its common stock is more reflective of market conditions, and given consistently high trade volumes of the options, can reasonably be expected to be a better indicator of expected volatility than historical volatility of its common stock.\n\nIn valuing shares issued under the Company’s employee stock option plans, the Company bases the risk-free interest rate on U.S. Treasury zero-coupon issues with terms similar to the contractual term of the options. The Company does not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future and therefore uses an expected dividend yield of\xa0zero\xa0in the option valuation model. The Company does not use a post-vesting termination rate as options are fully vested upon grant date.\n\n55", 'Table of Contents\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  |  |\n| 8. | Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss |\n\nThe following table summarizes the changes in accumulated balances of other comprehensive loss, net of tax:\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | | | | | | | | | | | |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|  | Foreign currency | | |  | Change in unrealized gains on available-for-sale securities | | |  | Total | | |\n|  | (in thousands) | | | | | | | | | | |\n| Balances as of December 31, 2014 | $ | (4,615 | ) |  | $ | 169 |  |  | $ | (4,446 | ) |\n| Other comprehensive loss before reclassifications | (37,887 | | ) |  | (771 | | ) |  | (38,658 | | ) |\n| Amounts reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive (loss)income | — | |  |  | (204 | | ) |  | (204 | | ) |\n| Net increase in other comprehensive loss | (37,887 | | ) |  | (975 | | ) |  | (38,862 | | ) |\n| Balances as of December 31, 2015 | $ | (42,502 | ) |  | $ | (806 | ) |  | $ | (43,308 | ) |\n| Other comprehensive (loss) income before reclassifications | (5,464 | | ) |  | 310 | |  |  | (5,154 | | ) |\n| Amounts reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive (loss)income | — | |  |  | (103 | | ) |  | (103 | | ) |\n| Net (increase) decrease in other comprehensive loss | (5,464 | | ) |  | 207 | |  |  | (5,257 | | ) |\n| Balances as of December 31, 2016 | $ | (47,966 | ) |  | $ | (599 | ) |  | $ | (48,565 | ) |\n\nAs discussed in Note 1, other comprehensive (loss) income for the year ended December\xa031, 2015 includes the impact of the change in functional currency for certain of the Company\'s European entities.\n\nAll amounts reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive (loss) income related to realized gains on available-for-sale securities.

However, an estimate of the range of reasonably possible adjustments cannot be made.\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  |  |\n| 10. | Employee Benefit Plan |\n\nThe Company maintains a 401(k) savings plan covering substantially all of its employees. Eligible employees may contribute up to 60% of their annual salary through payroll deductions, but not more than the statutory limits set by the Internal Revenue Service. The Company matches employee contributions at the discretion of the Board. During 2016, 2015 and 2014, the Company’s matching contributions totaled $15.7 million, $11.2 million and $8.3 million, respectively.\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  |  |\n| 11. | Segment Information |\n\nThe Company has three reportable segments: Domestic streaming, International streaming and Domestic DVD. Segment information is presented in the same manner that the Company’s chief operating decision maker ("CODM") reviews the operating results in assessing performance and allocating resources. The Company’s CODM reviews revenue and contribution profit (loss) for each of the reportable segments. Contribution profit (loss) is defined as revenues less cost of revenues and marketing expenses incurred by the segment. The Company has aggregated the results of the International operating segments into one reportable segment because these operating segments share similar long-term economic and other qualitative characteristics.\n\nThe Domestic streaming segment derives revenues from monthly membership fees for services consisting solely of streaming content to the members in the United States. The International streaming segment derives revenues from monthly membership fees for services consisting solely of streaming content to members outside of the United States. The Domestic DVD segment derives revenues from monthly membership fees for services consisting solely of DVD-by-mail. Revenues and the related payment card fees are attributed to the operating segment based on the nature of the underlying membership (streaming or DVD) and the geographic region from which the membership originates. There are no internal revenue transactions between the Company’s segments.\n\nThe vast majority of the cost of revenues relate to content expenses, which include the amortization of streaming content assets and other costs associated with the licensing and acquisition of streaming content. In connection with the Company\'s global expansion, content acquired, licensed, and produced increasingly includes global rights. The Company allocates this content between the International and Domestic streaming segments based on estimated fair market value. Content expenses for each streaming segment thus includes both expenses directly incurred by the segment as well as an allocation of expenses incurred for global rights. Other costs of revenues such as delivery costs are primarily attributed to the operating segment based on amounts directly incurred by the segment. Marketing expenses consist primarily of advertising expenses and payments made to our device partners, MVPD\'s, mobile platforms and ISP\'s which are generally included in the segment in which the expenditures are directly incurred.\n\nThe Company\'s long-lived tangible assets were located as follows:\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | | | | |

subscription or a member) is defined as the right to receive the Netflix service following sign-up and a method of payment being provided. Memberships are assigned to territories based on the geographic location used at time of sign-up as determined by our internal systems, which utilize industry standard geo-location technology. We offer free-trial memberships to new and certain rejoining members. Total members include those who are on a free-trial as long as a method of payment has been provided. A membership is canceled and ceases to be reflected in the above metrics as of the effective cancellation date. Voluntary cancellations become effective at the end of the prepaid membership period, while involuntary cancellation of the service, as a result of a failed method of payment, becomes effective immediately except in limited circumstances where a short grace period is offered to ensure the streaming service is not interrupted for members who are impacted by payment processing delays by our banks or integrated payment partners. The number of members in a grace period at any given point is not material. |\n\n61', 'Table of Contents\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  |  |\n| 12. | Selected Quarterly Financial Data (Unaudited) |\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|  | December\xa031 | | |  | September\xa030 | | |  | June\xa030 | | |  | March\xa031 | | |\n|  | (in thousands, except for per share data) | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |\n| 2016 |  | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |\n| Total revenues | $ | 2,477,541 |  |  | $ | 2,290,188 |  |  | $ | 2,105,204 |  |  | $ | 1,957,736 |  |\n| Gross profit | 823,122 | |  |  | 757,344 | |  |  | 632,106 | |  |  | 588,196 | |  |\n| Net income | 66,748 | |  |  | 51,517 | |  |  | 40,755 | |  |  | 27,658 | |  |\n| Earnings per share: |  | | |  |  | | |  |  | | |  |  | | |\n| Basic | $ | 0.16 |  |  | $ | 0.12 |  |  | $ | 0.10 |  |  | $ | 0.06 |  |\n| Diluted | 0.15 | |  |  | 0.12 | |  |  | 0.09 | |  |  | 0.06 | |  |\n| 2015 |  | | |  |  | | |  |  | | |  |  | | |\n| Total revenues | $ | 1,823,333 |  |  | $ | 1,738,355 |  |  | $ | 1,644,694 |  |  | $ | 1,573,129 |  |\n| Gross profit | 573,968 | |  |  | 564,397 | |  |  | 522,942 | |  |  | 526,728 | |  |\n| Net income | 43,178 | |  |  | 29,432 | |  |  | 26,335 | |  |  | 23,696 | |  |\n| Earnings per share: |  | | |  |  | | |  |  | | |  |  | | |\n| Basic | $ | 0.10 |  |  | $ | 0.07 |  |  | $ | 0.06 |  |  | $ | 0.06 |  |\n| Diluted | 0.10 | |  |  | 0.07 | |  |  | 0.06 | |  |  | 0.05 | |  |\n\n62', 'Table of Contents\n\nSIGNATURES\n\nPursuant to the requirements of Section\xa013 or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned, thereunto duly authorized.\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | | | | | |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|  |  |  | Netflix, Inc. | | |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| Dated: | January 27, 2017 |  | By: |  | /S/\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0REED\xa0HASTINGS |\n|  |  |  |  |  | Reed Hastings  Chief Executive Officer  (principal executive officer) |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| Dated: | January 27, 2017 |  | By: |  | /S/\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0DAVID\xa0WELLS |\n|  |  |  |  |  | David Wells  Chief Financial Officer  (principal financial and accounting officer) |\n\n63', 'Table of Contents\n\nPOWER OF ATTORNEY\n\nKNOWN ALL PERSONS BY THESE PRESENTS, that each person whose signature appears below constitutes and appoints Reed Hastings and David Wells, and each of them, as his true and lawful attorneys-in-fact and agents, with full power of substitution and resubstitution, for him and in his name, place, and stead, in any and all capacities, to sign any and all amendments to this Report, and to file the same, with all exhibits thereto, and other documents in connection therewith, with the Securities and Exchange Commission, granting unto said attorneys-in-fact and agents, and each of them, full power and authority to do and perform each and every act and thing requisite and necessary to be done in connection therewith, as fully to all intents and purposes as he might or could do in person, hereby ratifying and confirming that all said attorneys-in-fact and agents, or any of them or their or his substitute or substituted, may lawfully do or cause to be done by virtue thereof.\n\nPursuant to the requirements of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, this Annual Report on Form 10-K has been signed below by the following persons on behalf of the registrant and in the capacities and on the dates indicated.\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | | | | |\n|  |  |  |  |  |\n| Signature |  | Title |  | Date |\n| /S/\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0REED\xa0HASTINGS |  | President,\xa0Chief\xa0Executive\xa0Officer and Director (principal executive officer) |  | January\xa027, 2017 |\n| Reed Hastings |  |  |\n|  |  |  |  |  |\n| /S/\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0DAVID\xa0WELLS |  | Chief Financial Officer (principal financial and accounting officer) |  | January\xa027, 2017 |\n| David Wells |  |  |\n|  |  |  |  |  |\n| /S/\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0RICHARD\xa0BARTON |  | Director |  | January\xa027, 2017 |\n| Richard Barton |  |  |\n|  |  |  |  |  |\n| /S/\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0TIMOTHY M.

(“Netflix”, “the Company”, “we”, or “us”) is the world’s leading Internet television network with over 75 million streaming members in over 190 countries enjoying more than 125 million hours of TV shows and movies per day, including original series, documentaries and feature films. Our members can watch as much as they want, anytime, anywhere, on nearly any Internet-connected screen. Members can play, pause and resume watching, all without commercials or commitments. Additionally, in the United States ("U.S."), our members can receive DVDs delivered quickly to their homes.\n\nWe are a pioneer in the Internet delivery of TV shows and movies, launching our streaming service in 2007. Since this launch, we have developed an ecosystem for Internet-connected screens and have added increasing amounts of content that enable consumers to enjoy TV shows and movies directly on their Internet-connected screens. As a result of these efforts, we have experienced growing consumer acceptance of, and interest in, the delivery of TV shows and movies directly over the Internet.\n\nOur core strategy is to grow our streaming membership business globally within the parameters of our consolidated net income and operating segment contribution profit (loss) targets. We are continuously improving our members\' experience by expanding our streaming content with a focus on a programming mix of content that delights our members. In addition, we are perpetually enhancing our user interface and extending our streaming service to more Internet-connected screens.\n\nWe continue to grow our streaming service both domestically and internationally. We began our international expansion with Canada in 2010 and have since launched our service globally, with the exception of The People\'s Republic of China and territories where U.S. companies are not allowed to operate. We have also expanded our streaming content offering to include more exclusive and original programming, including several Emmy, Golden Globe and Academy Award nominated original series and documentaries. Our original programming increasingly includes content that we produce.\n\nBUSINESS SEGMENTS\n\nThe Company has three reportable segments: Domestic streaming, International streaming and Domestic DVD. The Domestic streaming segment derives revenues from monthly membership fees for services consisting solely of streaming content to our members in the United States. The International streaming segment derives revenues from monthly membership fees for services consisting solely of streaming content to our members outside the United States. The Domestic DVD segment derives revenues from monthly membership fees for services consisting solely of DVD-by-mail. For additional information regarding our segments, including information about our financial results by geography, see Note 12 of Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\n\n  \n\n1', 'Table of Contents\n\n  \n\nCOMPETITION\n\nThe market for entertainment video is intensely competitive and subject to rapid change. We compete against other entertainment video providers, such as multichannel video programming distributors ("MVPDs"), Internet-based movie and TV content providers (including those that provide pirated content), video gaming providers and DVD rental outlets and more broadly against other sources of entertainment that our members could choose in their moments of free time. We also compete against entertainment video providers in obtaining content that our members love, both for licensed streaming content and for original content projects.\n\nWhile consumers may maintain simultaneous relationships with multiple entertainment sources, we strive for consumers to choose us in their moments of free time. We have often referred to this choice as our objective of "winning moments of truth." In attempting to win these moments of truth with our members, we are continually improving our service, including both our technology and our content, which is increasingly exclusive and curated, and includes our own original programming.\n\nSEASONALITY\n\nOur membership growth exhibits a seasonal pattern that reflects variations when consumers buy Internet-connected screens and when they tend to increase their viewing. Historically, the first and fourth quarters (October through March)represent our greatest membership growth across our Domestic and International streaming segments and the fewest membership losses in our Domestic DVD segment. Our membership growth may be impacted by the release of certain high profile original content. Internationally, we expect each market to demonstrate more predictable seasonal patterns as our service offering in each market becomes more established and we have a longer history to assess such patterns.\n\nINTELLECTUAL PROPERTY\n\nWe regard our trademarks, service marks, copyrights, patents, domain names, trade dress, trade secrets, proprietary technologies and similar intellectual property as important to our success. We use a combination of patent, trademark, copyright and trade secret laws and confidentiality agreements to protect our proprietary intellectual property. Our ability to protect and enforce our intellectual property rights is subject to certain risks and from time to time we encounter disputes over rights and obligations concerning intellectual property. We cannot provide assurance that we will prevail in any intellectual property disputes.\n\nEMPLOYEES\n\nAs of December\xa031, 2015, we had approximately 3,700 total employees. Of these employees, approximately 3,500 were full-time, including approximately 400 categorized as temporary.\n\nOTHER INFORMATION\n\nWe were incorporated in Delaware in August 1997 and completed our initial public offering in May 2002. Our principal executive offices are located at 100 Winchester Circle, Los Gatos, California 95032, and our telephone number is (408)\xa0540-3700.\n\nWe maintain a Web site at www.netflix.com. The contents of our Web site are not incorporated in, or otherwise to be regarded as part of, this Annual Report on Form 10-K. In this Annual Report on Form 10-K, “Netflix,” the “Company,” “we,” “us,” “our” and the “registrant” refer to Netflix, Inc. We make available, free of charge on our Web site, access to our Annual Report on Form 10-K, our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, our Current Reports on Form 8-K and amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), as soon as reasonably practicable after we file or furnish them electronically with the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC").\n\nInvestors and others should note that we announce material financial information to our investors using our investor relations Web site (http://ir.netflix.com), SEC filings, press releases, public conference calls and webcasts. We use these channels as well as social media to communicate with our members and the public about our company, our services and other issues. It is possible that the information we post on social media could be deemed to be material information. Therefore, we encourage investors, the media, and others interested in our company to review the information we post on the social media channels listed on our investor relations Web site.\n\n  \n\n2', "Table of Contents\n\n  \n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  |  |\n| Item 1A. | Risk Factors |\n\nIf any of the following risks actually occur, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be harmed. In that case, the trading price of our common stock could decline, and you could lose all or part of your investment.\n\nRisks Related to Our Business\n\nIf our efforts to attract and retain members are not successful, our business will be adversely affected.\n\nWe have experienced significant membership growth over the past several years. Our ability to continue to attract members will depend in part on our ability to consistently provide our members with compelling content choices, as well as a quality experience for selecting and viewing TV shows and movies. Furthermore, the relative service levels, content offerings, pricing and related features of competitors to our service may adversely impact our ability to attract and retain memberships. Competitors include other entertainment video providers, such as MVPDs, Internet-based movie and TV content providers (including those that provide pirated content) and DVD rental outlets. If consumers do not perceive our service offering to be of value, including if we introduce new or adjust existing features, adjust pricing or service offerings, or change the mix of content in a manner that is not favorably received by them, we may not be able to attract and retain members. In addition, many of our members are rejoining our service or originate from word-of-mouth advertising from existing members. If our efforts to satisfy our existing members are not successful, we may not be able to attract members, and as a result, our ability to maintain and/or grow our business will be adversely affected. Members cancel our service for many reasons, including a perception that they do not use the service sufficiently, the need to cut household expenses, availability of content is unsatisfactory, competitive services provide a better value or experience and customer service issues are not satisfactorily resolved. We must continually add new memberships both to replace canceled memberships and to grow our business beyond our current membership base. If growth rates slow faster than expected, given, in particular that our content costs are largely fixed in nature and contracted over several years, we may not be able to adjust our expenditures or increase our (per membership) revenues commensurate with the lowered growth rate such that our margins, liquidity and results of operation may be adversely impacted. If we are unable to successfully compete with current and new competitors in both retaining our existing memberships and attracting new memberships, our business will be adversely affected. Further, if excessive numbers of members cancel our service, we may be required to incur significantly higher marketing expenditures than we currently anticipate to replace these members with new members.\n\nChanges in competitive offerings for entertainment video, including the potential rapid adoption of piracy-based video offerings, could adversely impact our business.\n\nThe market for entertainment video is intensely competitive and subject to rapid change. Through new and existing distribution channels, consumers have increasing options to access entertainment video. The various economic models underlying these channels include subscription, transactional, ad-supported and piracy-based models. All of these have the potential to capture meaningful segments of the entertainment video market. Piracy, in particular, threatens to damage our business, as its fundamental proposition to consumers is so compelling and difficult to compete against: virtually all content for free. Furthermore, in light of the compelling consumer proposition, piracy services are subject to rapid global growth. Traditional providers of entertainment video, including broadcasters and cable network operators, as well as Internet based e-commerce or entertainment video providers are increasing their Internet-based video offerings.  Several of these competitors have long operating histories, large customer bases, strong brand recognition and significant financial, marketing and other resources. They may secure better terms from suppliers, adopt more aggressive pricing and devote more resources to product development, technology, infrastructure, content acquisitions and marketing. New entrants may enter the market or existing providers may adjust their services with unique offerings or approaches to providing entertainment video. Companies also may enter into business combinations or alliances that strengthen their competitive positions. If we are unable to successfully or profitably compete with current and new competitors, our business will be adversely affected, and we may not be able to increase or maintain market share, revenues or profitability.\n\nThe long-term and fixed cost nature of our content commitments may limit our operating flexibility and could adversely affect our liquidity and results of operations.\n\nIn connection with obtaining streaming content, we typically enter into multi-year commitments with studios and other content providers, the payment terms of which are not tied to member usage or the size of our membership base (“fixed cost”) but which may be tied to such factors as titles licensed and/or theatrical exhibition receipts. Such commitments are included in the Contractual Obligations section of Item\xa07, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Note 6, Commitments and Contingencies in Item 8. Given the multiple-year duration and largely fixed cost nature of content commitments, if membership acquisition and retention do not meet our expectations, our margins may be\n\n  \n\n3", 'Table of Contents\n\n  \n\nadversely impacted. Payment terms for certain content commitments, such as programming that is initially available in the applicable territory on our service (“original programming”), will typically require more up-front cash payments than other licensing agreements. To the extent membership and/or revenue growth do not meet our expectations, our liquidity and results of operations could be adversely affected as a result of content commitments and accelerated payment requirements of certain agreements. In addition, the long-term and fixed cost nature of our content commitments may limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to changes in our business and the market segments in which we operate. As we have expanded internationally, we have licensed content in advance of entering into a new geographical market. If we license content that is not favorably received by consumers in the applicable territory, or is unable to be shown in the applicable territory, acquisition and retention may be adversely impacted and given the long-term and fixed cost nature of our content commitments, we may not be able to adjust our content offering quickly and our results of operation may be adversely impacted.\n\nWe are devoting more resources toward the development, production, marketing and distribution of original programming, including TV series and movies. We believe that original programming can help differentiate our service from other offerings, enhance our brand and otherwise attract and retain members. To the extent our original programming does not meet our expectations, in particular, in terms of costs, viewing and popularity, our business, including our brand and results of operations may be adversely impacted.\n\nIf we are not able to manage change and growth, our business could be adversely affected.\n\nWe are expanding our operations internationally, scaling our streaming service to effectively and reliably handle anticipated growth in both members and features related to our service, ramping up our ability to produce original content, as well as continuing to operate our DVD service within the U.S. As we expand internationally, we are managing and adjusting our business to address varied content offerings, consumer customs and practices, in particular those dealing with e-commerce and Internet video, as well as differing legal and regulatory environments. As we scale our streaming service, we are developing technology and utilizing third-party “cloud” computing services. As we ramp up our original content production, we are building out expertise in a number of disciplines, including creative, marketing, legal, finance and other resources related to the development and physical production of content. If we are not able to manage the growing complexity of our business, including improving, refining or revising our systems and operational practices related to our streaming operations and original content, our business may be adversely affected.\n\nWe could be subject to economic, political, regulatory and other risks arising from our international operations.\n\nOperating in international markets requires significant resources and management attention and will subject us to regulatory, economic and political risks that may be different from or incremental to those in the U.S. In addition to the risks that we face in the U.S., our international operations involve risks that could adversely affect our business, including:\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  |  |\n| • | the need to adapt our content and user interfaces for specific cultural and language differences, including licensing a certain portion of our content assets before we have developed a full appreciation for its performance within a given territory; |\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  |  |\n| • | difficulties and costs associated with staffing and managing foreign operations; |\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  |  |\n| • | management distraction; |\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  |  |\n| • | political or social unrest and economic instability; |\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  |  |\n| • | compliance with U.S. laws such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, export controls and economic sanctions, and local laws prohibiting corrupt payments to government officials; |\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  |  |\n| • | difficulties in understanding and complying with local laws, regulations and customs in foreign jurisdictions; |\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  |  |\n| • | regulatory requirements or government action against our service, whether in response to enforcement of actual or purported legal and regulatory requirements or otherwise, that results in disruption or non-availability of our service or particular content in the applicable jurisdiction; |\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  |  |\n| • | less favorable foreign intellectual property laws; |\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  |  |\n| • | adverse tax consequences such as those related to repatriation of cash from foreign jurisdictions into the United States, non-income related taxes such as value-added tax or other indirect taxes, changes in tax laws or their interpretations, or the application of judgment in determining our global provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities given intercompany transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain; |\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  |  |\n| • | fluctuations in currency exchange rates, which we do not use foreign exchange contracts or derivatives to hedge against and which could impact revenues and expenses of our international operations and expose us to foreign currency exchange rate risk; |\n\n  \n\n4', 'Table of Contents\n\n  \n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  |  |\n| • | profit repatriation and other restrictions on the transfer of funds; |\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  |  |\n| • | differing payment processing systems as well as consumer use and acceptance of electronic payment methods, such as payment cards; |\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  |  |\n| • | new and different sources of competition; |\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  |  |\n| • | censorship requirements that cause us to remove or edit popular content, leading to consumer disappointment or dissatisfaction with our service; |\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  |  |\n| • | low usage and/or penetration of Internet- connected consumer electronic devices; |\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  |  |\n| • | different and more stringent user protection, data protection, privacy and other laws; |\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  |  |\n| • | availability of reliable broadband connectivity and wide area networks in targeted areas for expansion; |\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  |  |\n| • | integration and operational challenges as well as potential unknown liabilities in connection with companies we may acquire or control; and |\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  |  |\n| • | differing, and often more lenient, laws and consumer understanding/attitudes regarding the illegality of piracy. |\n\nOur failure to manage any of these risks successfully could harm our international operations and our overall business, and results of our operations.\n\nIf we fail to maintain or, in new markets establish, a positive reputation with consumers concerning our service, including the content we offer, we may not be able to attract or retain members, and our operating results may be adversely affected.\n\nWe believe that a positive reputation with consumers concerning our service is important in attracting and retaining members who have a number of choices from which to obtain entertainment video. To the extent our content, in particular, our original programming, is perceived as low quality, offensive or otherwise not compelling to consumers, our ability to establish and maintain a positive reputation may be adversely impacted. Furthermore, to the extent our marketing, customer service and public relations efforts are not effective or result in negative consumer reaction, our ability to establish and maintain a positive reputation may likewise be adversely impacted. As we expand into new markets, we will also need to establish our reputation with consumers and to the extent we are not successful in creating positive impressions, our business in these new markets may be adversely impacted.\n\nChanges in how we market our service could adversely affect our marketing expenses and membership levels may be adversely affected.\n\nWe utilize a broad mix of marketing and public relations programs, including social media sites such as Facebook and Twitter, to promote our service to potential new members. We may limit or discontinue use or support of certain marketing sources or activities if advertising rates increase or if we become concerned that members or potential members deem certain marketing practices intrusive or damaging to our brand. If the available marketing channels are curtailed, our ability to attract new members may be adversely affected.\n\nIf companies that promote our service decide that we negatively impact their business, that they want to compete more directly with our business or enter a similar business or decide to exclusively support our competitors, we may no longer have access to such marketing channels. We also acquire a number of members who rejoin our service having previously cancelled their membership. If we are unable to maintain or replace our sources of members with similarly effective sources, or if the cost of our existing sources increases, our member levels and marketing expenses may be adversely affected\n\nWe face risks, such as unforeseen costs and potential liability in connection with content we acquire, produce, license and/or distribute through our service.\n\nAs a distributor of content, we face potential liability for negligence, copyright and trademark infringement, or other claims based on the nature and content of materials that we acquire, produce, license and/or distribute. We also may face potential liability for content used in promoting our service, including marketing materials and features on our Web site such as member reviews. As we expand our original programming, we have become responsible for production costs and other expenses, such as ongoing guild payments. We also take on risks associated with production, such as completion and key talent risk. To the extent we do not accurately anticipate costs or mitigate risks, including for content that we obtain but ultimately does not appear on our service, or if we become liable for content we acquire, produce, license and/or distribute, our business may suffer. Litigation to defend these claims could be costly and the expenses and damages arising from any liability or unforeseen production risks could harm our results of operations. We may not be indemnified against claims or costs of these types and we may not have insurance coverage for these types of claims.\n\n  \n\n5', "Table of Contents\n\n  \n\nIf studios, content providers or other rights holders refuse to license streaming content or other rights upon terms acceptable to us, our business could be adversely affected.\n\nOur ability to provide our members with content they can watch depends on studios, content providers and other rights holders licensing rights to distribute such content and certain related elements thereof, such as the public performance of music contained within the content we distribute. The license periods and the terms and conditions of such licenses vary. If the studios, content providers and other rights holders are not or are no longer willing or able to license us content upon terms acceptable to us, our ability to stream content to our members will be adversely affected and/or our costs could increase. Many of the licenses for content provide for the studios or other content providers to withdraw content from our service relatively quickly. Because of these provisions as well as other actions we may take, content available through our service can be withdrawn on short notice. As competition increases, we may see the cost of programming increase. As we seek to differentiate our service, we are increasingly focused on securing certain exclusive rights when obtaining content, including original content. We are also focused on programming an overall mix of content that delights our members in a cost efficient manner. Within this context, we are selective about the titles we add and renew to our service. If we do not maintain a compelling mix of content, our membership acquisition and retention may be adversely affected.\n\nMusic contained within content we distribute may require us to obtain licenses for such distribution. In this regard, we engage in negotiations with collection management organizations (“CMOs”) that hold certain rights to music interests in connection with streaming content into various territories. If we are unable to reach mutually acceptable terms with these organizations, we could become involved in litigation and/or could be enjoined from distributing certain content, which could adversely impact our business. Additionally, pending and ongoing litigation as well as negotiations between certain CMOs and other third parties in various territories could adversely impact our negotiations with CMOs, or result in music publishers represented by certain CMOs unilaterally withdrawing rights, and thereby adversely impact our ability to reach licensing agreements reasonably acceptable to us. Failure to reach such licensing agreements could expose us to potential liability for copyright infringement or otherwise increase our costs.\n\nWe rely upon a number of partners to make our service available on their devices.\n\nWe currently offer members the ability to receive streaming content through a host of Internet-connected screens, including TVs, digital video players, television set-top boxes and mobile devices. We have agreements with various cable, satellite and telecommunications operators to make our service available through the television set-top boxes of these service providers.  We intend to continue to broaden our capability to instantly stream TV shows and movies to other platforms and partners over time. If we are not successful in maintaining existing and creating new relationships, or if we encounter technological, content licensing, regulatory or other impediments to delivering our streaming content to our members via these devices, our ability to grow our business could be adversely impacted. Our agreements with our device partners are typically between one and three years in duration and our business could be adversely affected if, upon expiration, a number of our partners do not continue to provide access to our service or are unwilling to do so on terms acceptable to us, which terms may include the degree of accessibility and prominence of our service. Furthermore, devices are manufactured and sold by entities other than Netflix and while these entities should be responsible for the devices' performance, the connection between these devices and Netflix may nonetheless result in consumer dissatisfaction toward Netflix and such dissatisfaction could result in claims against us or otherwise adversely impact our business. In addition, technology changes to our streaming functionality may require that partners update their devices. If partners do not update or otherwise modify their devices, our service and our members' use and enjoyment could be negatively impacted.\n\nAny significant disruption in or unauthorized access to our computer systems or those of third parties that we utilize in our operations, including those relating to cybersecurity or arising from cyber-attacks, could result in a loss or degradation of service, unauthorized disclosure of data, including member and corporate information, or theft of intellectual property, including digital content assets, which could adversely impact our business.\n\nOur reputation and ability to attract, retain and serve our members is dependent upon the reliable performance and security of our computer systems and those of third parties that we utilize in our operations. These systems may be subject to damage or interruption from earthquakes, adverse weather conditions, other natural disasters, terrorist attacks, power loss, telecommunications failures, and cybersecurity risks. Interruptions in these systems, or with the Internet in general, could make our service unavailable or degraded or otherwise hinder our ability to deliver streaming content or fulfill DVD selections. Service interruptions, errors in our software or the unavailability of computer systems used in our operations could diminish the overall attractiveness of our membership service to existing and potential members.\n\nOur computer systems and those of third parties we use in our operations are vulnerable to cybersecurity risks, including cyber-attacks such as computer viruses, denial of service attacks, physical or electronic break-ins and similar disruptions. These systems periodically experience directed attacks intended to lead to interruptions and delays in our service and operations as well as loss, misuse or theft of data. Any attempt by hackers to obtain our data (including member and corporate\n\n  \n\n6", 'Table of Contents\n\n  \n\ninformation) or intellectual property (including digital content assets), disrupt our service, or otherwise access our systems, or those of third parties we use, if successful, could harm our business, be expensive to remedy and damage our reputation. We have implemented certain systems and processes to thwart hackers and protect our data and systems. To date hackers have not had a material impact on our service or systems however this is no assurance that hackers may not be successful in the future. Our insurance does not cover expenses related to such disruptions or unauthorized access. Efforts to prevent hackers from disrupting our service or otherwise accessing our systems are expensive to implement and may limit the functionality of or otherwise negatively impact our service offering and systems. Any significant disruption to our service or access to our systems could result in a loss of memberships and adversely affect our business and results of operation.\n\nWe utilize our own communications and computer hardware systems located either in our facilities or in that of a third-party Web hosting provider. In addition, we utilize third-party “cloud” computing services in connection with our business operations. We also utilize our own and third-party content delivery networks to help us stream TV shows and movies in high volume to Netflix members over the Internet. Problems faced by us or our third-party Web hosting, "cloud" computing, or other network providers, including technological or business-related disruptions, as well as cybersecurity threats, could adversely impact the experience of our members.\n\nWe rely upon Amazon Web Services to operate certain aspects of our service and any disruption of or interference with our use of the Amazon Web Services operation would impact our operations and our business would be adversely impacted.\n\nAmazon Web Services ("AWS") provides a distributed computing infrastructure platform for business operations, or what is commonly referred to as a "cloud" computing service. We have architected our software and computer systems so as to utilize data processing, storage capabilities and other services provided by AWS. Currently, we run the vast majority of our computing on AWS. Given this, along with the fact that we cannot easily switch our AWS operations to another cloud provider, any disruption of or interference with our use of AWS would impact our operations and our business would be adversely impacted. While the retail side of Amazon competes with us, we do not believe that Amazon will use the AWS operation in such a manner as to gain competitive advantage against our service.\n\nIf the technology we use in operating our business fails, is unavailable, or does not operate to expectations, our business and results of operation could be adversely impacted.\n\nWe utilize a combination of proprietary and third party technology to operate our business. This includes the technology that we have developed to recommend and merchandise content to our consumers as well as enable fast and efficient delivery of content to our members and their various consumer electronic devices. For example, we have built and deployed our own content-delivery network (“CDN”). To the extent Internet Service Providers ("ISPs") do not interconnect with our CDN, or if we experience difficulties in its operation, our ability to efficiently and effectively deliver our streaming content to our members could be adversely impacted and our business and results of operation could be adversely affected. Likewise, if our recommendation and merchandising technology does not enable us to predict and recommend titles that our members will enjoy, our ability to attract and retain members may be adversely affected. We also utilize third party technology to help market our service, process payments, and otherwise manage the daily operations of our business. If our technology or that of third parties we utilize in our operations fails or otherwise operates improperly, our ability to operate our service, retain existing members and add new members may be impaired. Also, any harm to our members\' personal computers or other devices caused by software used in our operations could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\n\nIf government regulations relating to the Internet or other areas of our business change, we may need to alter the manner in which we conduct our business, or incur greater operating expenses.\n\nThe adoption or modification of laws or regulations relating to the Internet or other areas of our business could limit or otherwise adversely affect the manner in which we currently conduct our business. In addition, the continued growth and development of the market for online commerce may lead to more stringent consumer protection laws, which may impose additional burdens on us. If we are required to comply with new regulations or legislation or new interpretations of existing regulations or legislation, this compliance could cause us to incur additional expenses or alter our business model.\n\nChanges in laws or regulations that adversely affect the growth, popularity or use of the Internet, including laws impacting net neutrality, could decrease the demand for our service and increase our cost of doing business. The failure to adopt laws protecting strong net neutrality could also increase the cost of doing business. \xa0In the United States, on February 16, 2015, the Federal Communications Commission ("FCC") adopted net neutrality rules intended, in part, to prevent network operators from discriminating against legal traffic that transverse their networks and to prevent ISP abuses at interconnection points. The FCC\'s authority to adopt these rules is currently under review by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of\n\n  \n\n7', "Table of Contents\n\n  \n\nColumbia. To the extent network operators attempt to use this ruling to extract fees from us to deliver our traffic or otherwise engage in discriminatory practices, or if the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia invalidates the rules, our business could be adversely impacted. Regulators outside the United States, including the European Union, have adopted or may adopt Network Neutrality rules. It is also possible that network neutrality rules may be nascent or non-existent in the global markets in which we operate. Within such a regulatory environment, coupled with potentially significant political and economic power of local network operators, we could experience discriminatory or anti-competitive practices that could impede our growth, cause us to incur additional expense or otherwise negatively affect our business.\n\nChanges in how network operators handle and charge for access to data that travel across their networks could adversely impact our business.\n\nWe rely upon the ability of consumers to access our service through the Internet. If network operators block, restrict or otherwise impair access to our service over their networks, our service and business could be negatively affected. To the extent that network operators implement usage based pricing, including meaningful bandwidth caps, or otherwise try to monetize access to their networks by data providers, we could incur greater operating expenses and our membership acquisition and retention could be negatively impacted. Furthermore, to the extent network operators create tiers of Internet access service and either charge us for or prohibit us from being available through these tiers, our business could be negatively impacted.\n\nMost network operators that provide consumers with access to the Internet also provide these consumers with multichannel video programming. As such, many network operators have an incentive to use their network infrastructure in a manner adverse to our continued growth and success. While we believe that consumer demand, regulatory oversight and competition will help check these incentives, to the extent that network operators are able to provide preferential treatment to their data as opposed to ours or otherwise implement discriminatory network management practices, our business could be negatively impacted. In some international markets, these same incentives apply however, the consumer demand, regulatory oversight and competition may not be as strong as in our domestic market.\n\nPrivacy concerns could limit our ability to collect and leverage our membership data and disclosure of membership data could adversely impact our business and reputation.\n\nIn the ordinary course of business and in particular in connection with merchandising our service to our members, we collect and utilize data supplied by our members. We currently face certain legal obligations regarding the manner in which we treat such information. Other businesses have been criticized by privacy groups and governmental bodies for attempts to link personal identities and other information to data collected on the Internet regarding users' browsing and other habits. Increased regulation of data utilization practices, including self-regulation or findings under existing laws that limit our ability to collect and use data, could have an adverse effect on our business. In addition, if we were to disclose data about our members in a manner that was objectionable to them, our business reputation could be adversely affected, and we could face potential legal claims that could impact our operating results. As our business evolves and as we expand internationally, we may become subject to additional and/or more stringent legal obligations concerning our treatment of customer and other personal information, such as laws regarding data localization and/or restrictions on data export. Failure to comply with these obligations could subject us to liability, and to the extent that we need to alter our business model or practices to adapt to these obligations, we could incur additional expenses. For instance, in October 2015, the European Court of Justice overturned the E.U./U.S. Safe Harbor Program, under which companies were able to transfer personal data from the E.U. to the U.S. in a legally compliant manner. If other legally compliant forms of data transfer are similarly invalidated by courts or other authorities in the E.U., we may need to alter our business practices, and which may adversely affect our business.\n\nOur reputation and relationships with members would be harmed if our membership data, particularly billing data, were to be accessed by unauthorized persons.\n\nWe maintain personal data regarding our members, including names and billing data. This data is maintained on our own systems as well as that of third parties we use in our operations. With respect to billing data, such as credit card numbers, we rely on licensed encryption and authentication technology to secure such information. We take measures to protect against unauthorized intrusion into our members' data. Despite these measures we, our payment processing services or other third party services we use such as AWS, could experience an unauthorized intrusion into our members' data. In the event of such a breach, current and potential members may become unwilling to provide the information to us necessary for them to become members. Additionally, we could face legal claims for such a breach. The costs relating to any data breach could be material, and we currently do not carry insurance against the risk of a data breach. For these reasons, should an unauthorized intrusion into our members’ data occur, our business could be adversely affected.\n\n  \n\n8", "Table of Contents\n\n  \n\nWe are subject to payment processing risk.\n\nOur members pay for our service using a variety of different payment methods, including credit and debit cards, gift cards, direct debit and online wallets.\xa0 We rely on internal systems as well as those of third parties to process payment.\xa0 Acceptance and processing of these payment methods are subject to certain rules and regulations and require payment of interchange and other fees.\xa0 To the extent there are disruptions in our payment processing systems,\xa0increases in payment processing fees, material changes in the payment ecosystem, such as large re-issuances of payment cards, delays in receiving payments from payment processors and/or changes to rules or regulations concerning payment processing, our revenue, operating expenses and results of operation could be adversely impacted.\xa0\xa0 In addition, from time to time, we encounter fraudulent use of payment methods, which could impact our results of operation and if not adequately controlled and managed could create negative consumer perceptions of our service.\n\nIf our trademarks and other proprietary rights are not adequately protected to prevent use or appropriation by our competitors, the value of our brand and other intangible assets may be diminished, and our business may be adversely affected.\n\nWe rely and expect to continue to rely on a combination of confidentiality and license agreements with our employees, consultants and third parties with whom we have relationships, as well as trademark, copyright, patent and trade secret protection laws, to protect our proprietary rights. We may also seek to enforce our proprietary rights through court proceedings. We have filed and we expect to file from time to time for trademark and patent applications. Nevertheless, these applications may not be approved, third parties may challenge any copyrights, patents or trademarks issued to or held by us, third parties may knowingly or unknowingly infringe our intellectual property rights, and we may not be able to prevent infringement or misappropriation without substantial expense to us. If the protection of our intellectual property rights is inadequate to prevent use or misappropriation by third parties, the value of our brand and other intangible assets may be diminished, competitors may be able to more effectively mimic our service and methods of operations, the perception of our business and service to members and potential members may become confused in the marketplace, and our ability to attract members may be adversely affected.\n\nWe currently hold various domain names relating to our brand, including Netflix.com. Failure to protect our domain names could adversely affect our reputation and brand and make it more difficult for users to find our Web site and our service. We may be unable, without significant cost or at all, to prevent third parties from acquiring domain names that are similar to, infringe upon or otherwise decrease the value of our trademarks and other proprietary rights.\n\nIntellectual property claims against us could be costly and result in the loss of significant rights related to, among other things, our Web site, streaming technology, our recommendation and merchandising technology, title selection processes and marketing activities.\n\nTrademark, copyright, patent and other intellectual property rights are important to us and other companies. Our intellectual property rights extend to our technology, business processes and the content on our Web site. We use the intellectual property of third parties in merchandising our products and marketing our service through contractual and other rights. From time to time, third parties allege that we have violated their intellectual property rights. If we are unable to obtain sufficient rights, successfully defend our use, or develop non-infringing technology or otherwise alter our business practices on a timely basis in response to claims against us for infringement, misappropriation, misuse or other violation of third-party intellectual property rights, our business and competitive position may be adversely affected. Many companies are devoting significant resources to developing patents that could potentially affect many aspects of our business. There are numerous patents that broadly claim means and methods of conducting business on the Internet. We have not searched patents relative to our technology. Defending ourselves against intellectual property claims, whether they are with or without merit or are determined in our favor, results in costly litigation and diversion of technical and management personnel. It also may result in our inability to use our current Web site, streaming technology, our recommendation and merchandising technology or inability to market our service or merchandise our products. As a result of a dispute, we may have to develop non-infringing technology, enter into royalty or licensing agreements, adjust our merchandising or marketing activities or take other actions to resolve the claims. These actions, if required, may be costly or unavailable on terms acceptable to us.\n\nWe are engaged in legal proceedings that could cause us to incur unforeseen expenses and could occupy a significant amount of our management's time and attention.\n\nFrom time to time, we are subject to litigation or claims that could negatively affect our business operations and financial position. As we have grown, we have seen a rise in the number of litigation matters against us. These matters have included patent infringements as well as consumer and securities class actions, each of which are typically expensive to defend. Litigation disputes could cause us to incur unforeseen expenses, could occupy a significant amount of our management's time and attention and could negatively affect our business operations and financial position.\n\n  \n\n9", "Table of Contents\n\n  \n\nWe may seek additional capital that may result in stockholder dilution or that may have rights senior to those of our common stockholders.\n\nFrom time to time, we may seek to obtain additional capital, either through equity, equity-linked or debt securities. The decision to obtain additional capital will depend on, among other things, our business plans, operating performance and condition of the capital markets. If we raise additional funds through the issuance of equity, equity-linked or debt securities, those securities may have rights, preferences or privileges senior to the rights of our common stock, and our stockholders may experience dilution.\n\nWe have debt outstanding and may incur additional debt in the future, which may adversely affect our financial condition and future financial results.\n\nAs of December\xa031, 2015, we had $2,400 million aggregate principal amount of senior notes outstanding. Risks relating to our long-term indebtedness include:\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  |  |\n| • | requiring us to dedicate a portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and investments and other general corporate purposes; |\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  |  |\n| • | limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the markets in which we operate; and |\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  |  |\n| • | limiting our ability to borrow additional funds or to borrow funds at rates or on other terms we find acceptable. |\n\nIt is possible that we may incur additional indebtedness in the future in the ordinary course of business. If new debt is added to current debt levels, the risks described above could intensify.\n\nWe may lose key employees or may be unable to hire qualified employees.\n\nWe rely on the continued service of our senior management, including our Chief Executive Officer and co-founder Reed Hastings, members of our executive team and other key employees and the hiring of new qualified employees. In our industry, there is substantial and continuous competition for highly-skilled business, product development, technical and other personnel. We may not be successful in recruiting new personnel and in retaining and motivating existing personnel, which may be disruptive to our operations.\n\nIf memberships to our Domestic DVD segment decline faster than anticipated, our business could be adversely affected.\n\nThe number of memberships to our DVD-by-mail offering is declining, and we anticipate that this decline will continue. We believe, however, that the domestic DVD business will continue to generate significant contribution profit for our business. The contribution profit generated by our domestic DVD business will help provide capital resources to fund our growth internationally. To the extent that the rate of decline in our DVD-by-mail business is greater than we anticipate, our business could be adversely affected. We do not anticipate increasing resources to our DVD operations and the technology used in its operations will not be meaningfully improved. To the extent that we experience service interruptions or other degradations in our DVD-by-mail service, members' satisfaction could be negatively impacted and we could experience an increase in DVD-by-mail member cancellations, which could adversely impact our business.\n\nChanges in U.S. Postal rates or operations could adversely impact our operating results and member satisfaction.\n\nWe rely exclusively on the U.S. Postal Service to deliver DVDs from our shipping centers and to return DVDs to us from our members. Increases in postage delivery rates, including those resulting from changes to policies on the requirements of first class mail such as size, weight or machinability, could adversely affect our Domestic DVD segment's contribution profit. If the U.S. Postal Service were to implement other changes to improve its financial position, such as closing mail processing facilities or service reductions, such changes could lead to a decrease in customer satisfaction and our Domestic DVD segment's contribution profit could be adversely affected.\n\n  \n\n10", 'Table of Contents\n\n  \n\nRisks Related to Our Stock Ownership\n\nProvisions in our charter documents and under Delaware law could discourage a takeover that stockholders may consider favorable.\n\nOur charter documents may discourage, delay or prevent a merger or acquisition that a stockholder may consider favorable because they:\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  |  |\n| • | authorize our board of directors, without stockholder approval, to issue up to 10,000,000 shares of undesignated preferred stock; |\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  |  |\n| • | provide for a classified board of directors; |\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  |  |\n| • | prohibit our stockholders from acting by written consent; |\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  |  |\n| • | establish advance notice requirements for proposing matters to be approved by stockholders at stockholder meetings; and |\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  |  |\n| • | prohibit stockholders from calling a special meeting of stockholders. |\n\nAs a Delaware corporation, we are also subject to certain Delaware anti-takeover provisions. Under Delaware law, a corporation may not engage in a business combination with any holder of 15% or more of its capital stock unless the holder has held the stock for three years or, among other things, the board of directors has approved the transaction. Our board of directors could rely on Delaware law to prevent or delay an acquisition of us.\n\nIn addition, a merger or acquisition may trigger retention payments to certain executive employees under the terms of our Amended and Restated Executive Severance and Retention Incentive Plan, thereby increasing the cost of such a transaction.\n\nOur stock price is volatile.\n\nThe price at which our common stock has traded has fluctuated significantly. The price may continue to be volatile due to a number of factors including the following, some of which are beyond our control:\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  |  |\n| • | variations in our operating results, including our membership acquisition and retention, revenues, contribution profits, net income and free cash flow; |\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  |  |\n| • | variations between our actual operating results and the expectations of securities analysts, investors and the financial community; |\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  |  |\n| • | announcements of developments affecting our business, systems or expansion plans by us or others; |\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  |  |\n| • | competition, including the introduction of new competitors, their pricing strategies and services; |\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  |  |\n| • | market volatility in general; |\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  |  |\n| • | the level of demand for our stock, including the amount of short interest in our stock; and |\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  |  |\n| • | the operating results of our competitors. |\n\nAs a result of these and other factors, investors in our common stock may not be able to resell their shares at or above their original purchase price.\n\nFollowing certain periods of volatility in the market price of our securities, we became the subject of securities litigation. We may experience more such litigation following future periods of volatility. This type of litigation may result in substantial costs and a diversion of management’s attention and resources.\n\nFinancial forecasting may differ materially from actual results.\n\nGiven the dynamic nature of our business, and the inherent limitations in predicting the future, forecasts of our revenues, contribution margins, net income and number of total and paid membership additions and other financial and operating data may differ materially from actual results.

For the year ended December 31, 2015, the impact from membership growth was slightly offset by a decrease in average monthly revenue per paying streaming membership resulting from unfavorable foreign currency fluctuations impacting our International streaming segment. This was partially offset by increases resulting from price changes and plan mix. The decrease in operating income for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2014 is due primarily to increased marketing and headcount costs to support our international expansion in addition to increased content expenses as we continue to acquire, license and produce content, including more Netflix originals. Net income is further impacted by the increase in interest expense associated with our debt issuance in the first quarter of 2015 as well as to an increase in losses on foreign currency denominated transactions.\n\nWe offer three types of streaming membership plans. In the U.S. our basic plan is priced at $7.99 per month and includes access to standard definition quality streaming on a single screen at a time. Our most popular streaming plan is priced at $9.99 per month and includes access to high definition quality streaming on two screens concurrently. Our premium plan is priced at $11.99 per month and includes access to high definition and ultra-high definition quality content on four screens concurrently. Internationally, the membership plans are structured similarly to the U.S. and range in price from the U.S. dollar equivalent of approximately $5.00 to $18.00 per month.\n\nWe expect that from time to time the prices of our membership plans in each country may change. For instance, in the second half of 2015, we increased the price of our two-screen high definition plan in the U.S. and several European countries. In May 2014, in the U.S., we increased the price of our high definition plan from $7.99 per month to $8.99 per month with existing memberships grandfathered for a two year period. In October 2015, in the U.S., we increased the price of this same high definition plan from $8.99 per month to $9.99 per month with existing memberships grandfathered for a one year period. In 2016, the grandfathered pricing period will expire for a substantial number of U.S. memberships and the members will have the option of electing the basic streaming plan at $7.99 or continuing on the high definition plan at the higher price of $9.99.\n\nThe following represents the key elements to our segment results of operations:\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  |  |\n| • | We define contribution profit (loss) as revenues less cost of revenues and marketing expenses incurred by the segment. We believe this is an important measure of our operating segment performance as it represents each segment's performance before global corporate costs. |\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  |  |\n| • | For the Domestic and International streaming segments, content expenses, which include the amortization of the streaming content assets and other expenses associated with the licensing and acquisition of streaming content, represent the vast majority of cost of revenues. Streaming content rights were generally obtained for our current geographic regions. As we expanded internationally, we obtained additional rights for the new geographies. With our global expansion, we now aspire to obtain global rights for our new content. We allocate this content between the Domestic and International segments based on estimated fair market value. Other cost of revenues such as streaming delivery expenses, customer service and payment processing fees, including those we pay to our integrated payment partners, tend to be lower as a percentage of total cost of revenues as compared to content licensing expenses. We have built our |\n\n  \n\n17", 'Table of Contents\n\n  \n\nown global content delivery network ("Open Connect") to help us efficiently stream a high volume of content to our members over the Internet. Streaming delivery expenses, therefore, also include equipment costs related to our content delivery network and all third-party costs, such as cloud computing costs, associated with delivering streaming content over the Internet. Cost of revenues in the Domestic DVD segment consist primarily of delivery expenses, content expenses, including amortization of DVD content assets and revenue sharing expenses, and other expenses associated with our DVD processing and customer service centers. Delivery expenses for the Domestic DVD segment consist of the postage costs to mail DVDs to and from our members and the packaging and label costs for the mailers.\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  |  |\n| • | For the Domestic and International streaming segments, marketing expenses consist primarily of advertising expenses and payments made to our affiliates and device partners. Advertising expenses include promotional activities such as digital and television advertising. Payments to our affiliates and device partners include fixed fee and /or revenue sharing payments. Marketing expenses are incurred by our Domestic and International streaming segments given our focus on building consumer awareness of the streaming offerings and in particular our original content. Marketing expenses incurred by our International streaming segment have been significant and fluctuate dependent upon the number of international territories in which our streaming service is offered and the timing of the launch of new territories. We do not incur marketing expenses for the Domestic DVD segment. |\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  |  |\n| • | We have demonstrated our ability to grow domestic streaming contribution margin as evidenced by the increase in contribution margin from 17% in 2012 to 33% in 2015. As a result of our focus on growing the streaming segments, contribution margins for the Domestic and International streaming segments are lower than for our Domestic DVD segment. |\n\n  \n\n18', 'Table of Contents\n\n  \n\nSegment Results\n\nDomestic Streaming Segment\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|  |  | As of/ Year Ended December 31, | | | | | | | | | | |  | Change | | | | | | | | | | | | |\n|  |  | 2015 | | |  | 2014 | | |  | 2013 | | |  | 2015 vs. 2014 | | | | | |  | 2014 vs. 2013 | | | | | |\n|  |  | (in thousands, except revenue per membership and percentages) | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |\n| Memberships: |  |  | | |  |  | | |  |  | | |  |  | | |  |  | |  |  | | |  |  | |\n| Net additions |  | 5,624 | |  |  | 5,694 | |  |  | 6,274 | |  |  | (70 | | ) |  | (1 | )% |  | (580 | | ) |  | (9 | )% |\n| Memberships at end of period |  | 44,738 | |  |  | 39,114 | |  |  | 33,420 | |  |  | 5,624 | |  |  | 14 | % |  | 5,694 | |  |  | 17 | % |\n| Paid memberships at end of period |  | 43,401 | |  |  | 37,698 | |  |  | 31,712 | |  |  | 5,703 | |  |  | 15 | % |  | 5,986 | |  |  | 19 | % |\n| Average monthly revenue per paying membership |  | $ | 8.50 |  |  | $ | 8.14 |  |  | $ | 7.97 |  |  | $ | 0.36 |  |  | 4 | % |  | $ | 0.17 |  |  | 2 | % |\n|  |  |  | | |  |  | | |  |  | | |  |  | | |  |  | |  |  | | |  |  | |\n| Contribution profit: |  |  | | |  |  | | |  |  | | |  |  | | |  |  | |  |  | | |  |  | |\n| Revenues |  | $ | 4,180,339 |  |  | $ | 3,431,434 |  |  | $ | 2,751,375 |  |  | $ | 748,905 |  |  | 22 | % |  | $ | 680,059 |  |  | 25 | % |\n| Cost of revenues |  | 2,487,193 | |  |  | 2,201,761 | |  |  | 1,863,376 | |  |  | 285,432 | |  |  | 13 | % |  | 338,385 | |  |  | 18 | % |\n| Marketing |  | 317,646 | |  |  | 293,453 | |  |  | 265,232 | |  |  | 24,193 | |  |  | 8 | % |  | 28,221 | |  |  | 11 | % |\n| Contribution profit |  | 1,375,500 | |  |  | 936,220 | |  |  | 622,767 | |  |  | 439,280 | |  |  | 47 | % |  | 313,453 | |  |  | 50 | % |\n| Contribution margin |  | 33 | | % |  | 27 | | % |  | 23 | | % |  |  | | |  |  | |  |  | | |  |  | |\n\nYear ended December 31, 2015 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2014\n\nIn the Domestic streaming segment, we derive revenues from monthly membership fees for services consisting solely of streaming content to our members in the United States.

The increase in our domestic streaming revenues was due to a 17% growth in the average number of paid memberships and a 4% increase in average monthly revenue per paying membership resulting from our price changes and plan mix.\n\nThe increase in domestic streaming cost of revenues was primarily due to a $208.1 million increase in content expenses relating to our existing and new streaming content, including more exclusive and original programming. In addition, we had a $37.9 million increase in streaming delivery expenses and a $39.4 million increase in other costs, such as payment processing fees and customer service call centers, due to our growing member base.\n\nDomestic marketing expenses\xa0increased\xa0primarily due to an increase in advertising and public relations spending.\n\nOur Domestic streaming segment had a contribution margin of 33% for the year ended December 31, 2015, which increased as compared to the contribution margin of 27% for the year ended December 31, 2014 due to growth in paid memberships and revenue, which continued to outpace content and marketing spending. Our 2020 domestic streaming contribution margin target remains at 40%.\n\nYear ended December 31, 2014 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2013\n\nThe increase in our domestic streaming revenues was due to the 22% growth in the average number of paid memberships, as well as to the 2% increase in average monthly revenue per paying membership resulting from our price increase for new members in the second quarter of 2014 and introduction of the higher priced plan in 2013.\n\nThe increase in domestic streaming cost of revenues was primarily due to the $242.3 million increase in content expenses relating to our existing and new streaming content, including more exclusive and original programming.

We launched our streaming service in Canada in September 2010 and have continuously expanded our services internationally as shown below. In January 2016 we announced the availability of our streaming service virtually everywhere in the world, with the exception of The People's Republic of China and territories where U.S. companies are not allowed to operate.\n\n![](timeline.jpg)\n\nYear ended December 31, 2015 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2014\n\nThe increase in our international revenues was due to the 66% growth in the average number of paid international memberships offset partially by a\xa010%\xa0decrease in average monthly revenue per paying membership. The decrease in average monthly revenue per paying membership was due to the impact of exchange rate fluctuations and to a lesser extent the impact of absorbing higher VAT rates across our European markets beginning January 1, 2015. These decreases were partially offset by our pricing changes and plan mix. We believe international revenues would have been approximately $331 million higher in 2015 if foreign exchange rates had remained consistent with those for the year ended December 31, 2014.\n\nThe increase in international cost of revenues was primarily due to a $522.1 million increase in content expenses primarily relating to expenses for territories launched in the last eighteen months, coupled with existing and new streaming content, including more exclusive and original programming. Other costs increased $104.2 million primarily due to increases in our streaming delivery expenses, costs associated with our customer service call centers and payment processing fees, all driven by our growing member base, partially offset by decreases resulting from exchange rate fluctuations. Average paid international streaming memberships accounted for 35% of total average paid streaming memberships as of December 31, 2015, as compared to 27% of total average paid streaming memberships as of December 31, 2014.\n\n  \n\n20", 'Table of Contents\n\n  \n\nInternational marketing expenses for the year ended December 31, 2015 increased as compared to the year ended December 31, 2014 mainly due to expenses for territories launched in the last eighteen months.\n\nInternational contribution losses increased $173.6 million year over year due to our increased spending for our international expansion and the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations.\n\nYear ended December 31, 2014 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2013\n\nThe increase in our international revenues was primarily due to the 82% growth in the average number of paid international memberships as well as the 1% increase in average monthly revenue per paying member resulting from the price increase on our most popular streaming plan and the introduction of the premium plan, offset partially by the impact of exchange rate fluctuations. Average paid international streaming memberships accounted for 27% of total average paid streaming memberships as of December 31, 2014, as compared to 20% of total average paid streaming memberships as of December 31, 2013.\n\nThe increase in international cost of revenues was primarily due to a $311.5 million increase in content expenses including content for our new markets as well as more exclusive and original programming. Other costs increased $60.3 million primarily due to increases in our streaming delivery expenses, costs associated with our customer service call centers and payment processing fees, all driven by our growing member base.\n\nInternational marketing expenses for the year ended December 31, 2014 increased as compared to the year ended December 31, 2013 mainly due to expenses for territories launched during 2014.\n\nInternational contribution losses improved $114.5 million year over year, as a result of growing memberships and revenues faster than content and marketing spending.\n\nDomestic DVD Segment\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|  |  | As of/ Year Ended December 31, | | | | | | | | | | |  | Change | | | | | | | | | | | | |\n|  |  | 2015 | | |  | 2014 | | |  | 2013 | | |  | 2015 vs. 2014 | | | | | |  | 2014 vs. 2013 | | | | | |\n|  |  | (in thousands, except revenue per membership and percentages) | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |\n| Memberships: |  |  | | |  |  | | |  |  | | |  |  | | |  |  | |  |  | | |  |  | |\n| Net losses |  | (863 | | ) |  | (1,163 | | ) |  | (1,294 | | ) |  | (300 | | ) |  | (26 | )% |  | (131 | | ) |  | (10 | )% |\n| Memberships at end of period |  | 4,904 | |  |  | 5,767 | |  |  | 6,930 | |  |  | (863 | | ) |  | (15 | )% |  | (1,163 | | ) |  | (17 | )% |\n| Paid memberships at end of period |  | 4,787 | |  |  | 5,668 | |  |  | 6,765 | |  |  | (881 | | ) |  | (16 | )% |  | (1,097 | | ) |  | (16 | )% |\n| Average monthly revenue per paying membership |  | $ | 10.30 |  |  | $ | 10.29 |  |  | $ | 10.25 |  |  | $ | 0.01 |  |  | — | % |  | $ | 0.04 |  |  | — | % |\n|  |  |  | | |  |  | | |  |  | | |  |  | | |  |  | |  |  | | |  |  | |\n| Contribution profit: |  |  | | |  |  | | |  |  | | |  |  | | |  |  | |  |  | | |  |  | |\n| Revenues |  | $ | 645,737 |  |  | $ | 765,161 |  |  | $ | 910,797 |  |  | $ | (119,424 | ) |  | (16 | )% |  | $ | (145,636 | ) |  | (16 | )% |\n| Cost of revenues |  | 323,908 | |  |  | 396,882 | |  |  | 471,523 | |  |  | (72,974 | | ) |  | (18 | )% |  | (74,641 | | ) |  | (16 | )% |\n| Marketing |  | — | |  |  | — | |  |  | 292 | |  |  | — | |  |  | — | % |  | (292 | | ) |  | (100 | )% |\n| Contribution profit |  | 321,829 | |  |  | 368,279 | |  |  | 438,982 | |  |  | (46,450 | | ) |  | (13 | )% |  | (70,703 | | ) |  | (16 | )% |\n| Contribution margin |  | 50 | | % |  | 48 | | % |  | 48 | | % |  |  | | |  |  | |  |  | | |  |  | |\n\nYear ended December 31, 2015 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2014\n\nIn the Domestic DVD segment, we derive revenues from our DVD-by-mail membership services. The price per plan for DVD-by-mail varies from $4.99 to $15.99 per month according to the plan chosen by the member. DVD-by-mail plans differ by the number of DVDs that a member may have out at any given point. Members electing access to high definition Blu-ray discs, in addition to standard definition DVDs, pay a surcharge ranging from $2 to $4 per month for our most popular plans.\n\nThe decrease in our domestic DVD revenues was due to a 16% decrease in the average number of paid memberships.\n\nThe decrease in domestic DVD cost of revenues was primarily due to a $21.0 million decrease in content expenses and a $38.9 million decrease in delivery expenses resulting from a 21% decrease in the number of DVDs mailed to members. The decrease in shipments was driven by a decline in the number of DVD memberships coupled with a decrease in usage by these members.

The foreign exchange loss was primarily driven by the remeasurement of significant content liabilities denominated in currencies other than functional currencies in our European entities coupled with the strengthening of the U.S. dollar.\n\nYear ended December 31, 2014 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2013\n\nInterest and other income (expense) for the year ended December 31, 2014 was relatively flat as compared to the prior year.

As a result, we recognized the retroactive benefit of the 2015 R&D credit as a discrete item in the fourth quarter of 2015, the period in which the legislation was enacted.\n\nYear ended December 31, 2014 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2013\n\nThe decrease in our effective tax rate for the year ended December\xa031, 2014 as compared to the year ended December\xa031, 2013 was primarily attributable to the $38.6 million release of tax reserves on previously unrecognized tax benefits.\n\nIn 2014, the difference between our 24% effective tax rate and the federal statutory rate of 35% was $39.7 million primarily due to a $38.6 million release of tax reserves on previously unrecognized tax benefits as a result of an IRS Appeals settlement for the tax years 2008-2009 leading to the reassessment of our reserves for all open years, $10.7 million related to the retroactive reinstatement of the 2014 Federal R&D credit and the California R&D credit; partially offset by state income taxes, foreign taxes and nondeductible expenses.\n\nOn December 19, 2014, the Tax Increase Prevention Act of 2014 (H.R. 5771) was signed into law which retroactively extended the Federal R&D credit from January 1, 2014 through December 31, 2014. As a result, we recognized the retroactive benefit of the 2014 Federal R&D credit as a discrete item in the fourth quarter of 2014, the period in which the legislation was enacted.\n\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\n\nCash, cash equivalents and short-term investments increased $702.2 million to $2,310.7 million from $1,608.5 million as of December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. In February 2015, we issued $1,500.0 million of long-term debt and in February 2014 we issued $400.0 million of long-term debt. The increases in cash in the year ended December 31, 2015 associated with the issuance of debt was partially offset by cash outflows from operations and investing activities. Long-term debt, net of debt issuance costs, was $2,371.4 million and $885.8 million as of December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, respectively. See Note 5 of Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for additional information.\n\nOur primary uses of cash include the acquisition, licensing and production of content, streaming delivery, marketing programs and payroll. Investments in original content and in particular content that we produce and own, require more cash upfront relative to licensed content. We expect to significantly increase our investments in global streaming content, particularly in original content, which could impact our liquidity and result in future negative free cash flows.\n\nAlthough we currently anticipate that cash flows from operations, together with our available funds, will continue to be sufficient to meet our cash needs for at least the next twelve months, to fund our continued content investments, we are likely to raise additional capital in future periods. Our ability to obtain this, or any additional financing that we may choose to, or need to, obtain to finance our international expansion, or investment in original content or otherwise, will depend on, among other things, our development efforts, business plans, operating performance and the condition of the capital markets at the time we seek financing. We may not be able to obtain such financing on terms acceptable to us or at all. If we raise additional funds through the issuance of equity or debt securities, those securities may have rights, preferences or privileges senior to the rights of our common stock, and our stockholders may experience dilution.\n\n  \n\n24', 'Table of Contents\n\n  \n\nAs of December 31, 2015, $200.3 million of cash and cash equivalents were held by our foreign subsidiaries. If these funds are needed for our operations in the U.S., we would be required to accrue and pay U.S. income taxes and foreign withholding taxes on the amount associated with undistributed earnings for certain foreign subsidiaries. As of December 31, 2015, the amount associated with undistributed earnings for certain foreign subsidiaries for which we could be required to accrue and pay taxes is $65.3 million. See Note 10 of Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for additional information.\n\nFree Cash Flow\n\nWe define free cash flow as cash (used in) provided by operating and investing activities excluding the non-operational cash flows from purchases, maturities and sales of short-term investments. We believe free cash flow is an important liquidity metric because it measures, during a given period, the amount of cash generated that is available to repay debt obligations, make investments and for certain other activities. Free cash flow is considered a non-GAAP financial measure and should not be considered in isolation of, or as a substitute for, net income, operating income, cash flow (used in) provided by operating activities, or any other measure of financial performance or liquidity presented in accordance with GAAP.\n\nIn assessing liquidity in relation to our results of operations, we compare free cash flow to net income, noting that the three major recurring differences are excess content payments over expense, non-cash stock-based compensation expense and other working capital differences. The excess content payments over expense is variable based on the payment terms of our content agreements and is expected to increase as we enter into more agreements with upfront cash payments, such as licensing and production of original content. In 2015, the ratio of content payments over content expense was between 1.3 and 1.4. Working capital differences include deferred revenue, taxes and semi-annual interest payments on our outstanding debt. Our receivables from members generally settle quickly and deferred revenue is a source of cash flow.\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | | | | | | | | | | | |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|  | Year Ended December\xa031, | | | | | | | | | | |\n|  | 2015 | | |  | 2014 | | |  | 2013 | | |\n|  | (in thousands) | | | | | | | | | | |\n| Net cash (used in) provided by operating activities | $ | (749,439 | ) |  | $ | 16,483 |  |  | $ | 97,831 |  |\n| Net cash used in investing activities | (179,192 | | ) |  | (42,866 | | ) |  | (255,968 | | ) |\n| Net cash provided by financing activities | 1,640,277 | |  |  | 541,712 | |  |  | 476,264 | |  |\n|  |  | | |  |  | | |  |  | | |\n| Non-GAAP free cash flow reconciliation: |  | | |  |  | | |  |  | | |\n| Net cash (used in) provided by operating activities | (749,439 | | ) |  | 16,483 | |  |  | 97,831 | |  |\n| Acquisition of DVD content assets | (77,958 | | ) |  | (74,790 | | ) |  | (65,927 | | ) |\n| Purchases of property and equipment | (91,248 | | ) |  | (69,726 | | ) |  | (54,143 | | ) |\n| Other assets | (1,912 | | ) |  | 1,334 | |  |  | 5,939 | |  |\n| Non-GAAP free cash flow | $ | (920,557 | ) |  | $ | (126,699 | ) |  | $ | (16,300 | ) |\n\nYear ended December 31, 2015 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2014\n\nCash provided by operating activities decreased $765.9 million resulting in net cash used in operating activities of $749.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The significant net cash used in operations is due primarily to the increase in investments in streaming content that requires more upfront payments. The payments for content excluding DVD assets increased $1,374.8 million or 40%. In addition we had increased payments associated with higher operating expenses. The increased use of cash was partially offset by a $1,274.9 million or 23% increase in revenues.\n\nCash used in investing activities increased $136.3 million, primarily due to a decrease of $108.4 million in the proceeds from sales and maturities of short-term investments, net of purchases. In addition, purchases of property and equipment increased by $21.5 million.\n\nCash provided by financing activities increased $1,098.6 million primarily due to the $1,482.4 million net proceeds from the issuance of the 5.50% Notes and the 5.875% Notes in the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to the $392.9 million net proceeds from the issuance of the 5.750% Notes in the year ended December 31, 2014.\n\nFree cash flow was $1,043.2 million lower than net income for the year ended December 31, 2015 primarily due to $1,209.4 million of content cash payments over expense partially offset by $124.7 million of non-cash stock-based compensation expense and $41.5 million of favorable other working capital differences.\n\n  \n\n25', 'Table of Contents\n\n  \n\nFree cash flow was $393.5 million lower than net income for the year ended December 31, 2014 primarily due to $534.2 million of content cash payments over expense partially offset by $115.2 million of non-cash stock-based compensation expense and $25.5 million of favorable other working capital differences.\n\nYear ended December 31, 2014 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2013\n\nCash provided by operating activities decreased $81.3 million, primarily due to increased payments for content other than DVD assets of $835.1 million or 32%, as well as increased payments associated with higher operating expenses. The increased use of cash was partially offset by a $1,130.1 million or 26% increase in revenues.\n\nCash used in investing activities decreased $213.1 million, primarily due to a decrease of $242.2 million in the purchases of short-term investments, net of proceeds from sales and maturities. This decrease was offset by an increase of $15.6 million purchases of property and equipment.\n\nCash provided by financing activities increased $65.4 million primarily due to the $392.9 million net proceeds from the issuance of the 5.750% Notes in the year ended December 31, 2014 as compared to the $490.6 million net proceeds from the issuance of the 5.375% Notes less the $219.4 million redemption of our 8.50% Notes in the year ended December 31, 2013. This increase was partially offset by a decrease of $56.3 million from the issuance of common stock, including the impact of excess tax benefits.\n\nFree cash flow was $128.7 million lower than net income for the year ended December 31, 2013 primarily due to $227.9 million of content cash payments over expense and $45.3 million non-favorable other working capital differences. This was partially offset by $73.1 million non-cash stock-based compensation expense, $46.3 million in deferred revenue and $25.1 million loss on debt extinguishment, the cash impact of which is a financing activity and therefore not included in free cash flow.\n\nContractual Obligations\n\nFor the purpose of this table, contractual obligations for purchases of goods or services are defined as agreements that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. The expected timing of the payment of the obligations discussed below is estimated based on information available to us as of December\xa031, 2015.

Traditional film output deals, like the U.S. output deal with Disney, or certain TV series license agreements where the number of seasons to be aired is unknown, are examples of these types of agreements. The contractual obligations table above does not include any estimated obligation for the unknown future titles, payment for which could range from less than one year to more than five years. However, these unknown obligations are expected to be significant and we believe could include approximately $3 billion to $5 billion over the next three years, with the payments for the vast majority of such amounts expected to occur after the next twelve months. The foregoing range is based on considerable management judgments and the actual amounts may differ. Once we know the title that we will receive and the license fees, we include the amount in the contractual obligations table above.\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  |  |\n| (2) | Long-term debt obligations include our Notes consisting of principal and interest payments. See Note 5 of Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for further details. |\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  |  |\n| (3) | Lease obligations include lease financing obligations of $21.1 million related to our current Los Gatos, California headquarters for which we are the deemed owner for accounting purposes, commitments of $428.7 million for our expanded headquarters in Los Gatos, California and our new office space in Los Angeles, California and other commitments of\xa0$79.9 million for facilities under non-cancelable operating leases. These leases have expiration dates varying through approximately 2028. |\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  |  |\n| (4) | Other purchase obligations include all other non-cancelable contractual obligations. These contracts are primarily related to streaming delivery, DVD content acquisition, and miscellaneous open purchase orders for which we have not received the related services or goods. |\n\nAs of December 31, 2015, we had gross unrecognized tax benefits of $17.1 million of which $3.6 million was recorded in "Accrued Expenses" in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. For the remaining $13.5 million, we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of payments in individual years due to uncertainties in the timing of tax audit outcomes, therefore, such amounts are not included in the above contractual obligation table.\n\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\n\nWe do not have transactions with unconsolidated entities, such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities, whereby we have financial guarantees, subordinated retained interests, derivative instruments, or other contingent arrangements that expose us to material continuing risks, contingent liabilities, or any other obligation under a variable interest in an unconsolidated entity that provides financing, liquidity, market risk, or credit risk support to us.\n\nIndemnifications\n\nThe information set forth under Note 7 of Item\xa08, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data under the caption “Guarantees—Indemnification Obligations” is incorporated herein by reference.\n\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\n\nThe preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported periods. The Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) has defined a company’s critical accounting policies as the ones that are most important to the portrayal of a company’s financial condition and results of operations, and which require a company to make its most difficult and subjective judgments. Based on this definition, we have identified the critical accounting policies and judgments addressed below. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates.\n\n  \n\n27', 'Table of Contents\n\n  \n\nStreaming Content\n\nWe acquire, license and produce content, including original programming, in order to offer our members unlimited viewing of TV shows and films. The content licenses are for a fixed fee and specific windows of availability. Payment terms for certain content licenses and the production of content require more upfront cash payments relative to the amortization expense. Payments for content, including additions to streaming assets and the changes in related liabilities, are classified within "Net cash (used in) provided by operating activities" on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.\n\nFor licenses we capitalize the fee per title and record a corresponding liability at the gross amount of the liability when the license period begins, the cost of the title is known and the title is accepted and available for streaming. The portion available for streaming within one year is recognized as “Current content assets, net” and the remaining portion as “Non-current content assets, net” on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\n\nFor productions we capitalize costs associated with the production, including development cost and direct costs. We include these amounts in "Non-current content assets, net" on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Participations and residuals are expensed in line with the amortization of production costs.\n\nBased on factors including historical and estimated viewing patterns, we amortize the content assets (licensed and produced) in “Cost of revenues” on the Consolidated Statements of Operations, over the shorter of each title\'s contractual window of availability or estimated period of use, beginning with the month of first availability. The amortization period typically ranges from six months to five years. For most of our content, we amortize on a straight-line basis. For certain content where we expect more upfront viewing, due to the additional merchandising and marketing efforts, we amortize on an accelerated basis. We review factors that impact the amortization of the content assets on a regular basis, including changes in merchandising and marketing efforts. Our estimates related to these factors require considerable management judgment.\xa0 Changes in our estimates could have a significant impact on our future results of operations. In the third quarter of 2015, we changed the amortization method of certain content given changes in estimated viewing patterns of this content. The effect of this change in estimate was a $25.5 million increase in cost of revenues in the Domestic streaming segment, for the year ended December 31, 2015.\n\nContent assets are stated at the lower of unamortized cost or net realizable value, which approximates fair value of the capitalized costs for produced content. Content assets are reviewed in aggregate at the operating segment level for write-down when an event or change in circumstances indicates a change in the expected usefulness of the content. Unamortized costs for assets that have been, or are expected to be, abandoned are written off. No material write-down from unamortized cost to a lower net realizable value was recorded in any of the periods presented.\n\nWe have entered into certain licenses with collective management organizations ("CMOs"), and are currently involved in negotiations with other CMOs, that hold certain rights to music and other entertainment works "publicly performed" in connection with streaming content into various territories. Accruals for estimated license fees are recorded and then adjusted based on any changes in estimates. These amounts are included in the streaming content obligations. The results of these negotiations are uncertain and may be materially different from management\'s estimates.\n\nIncome Taxes\n\nWe record a provision for income taxes for the anticipated tax consequences of our reported results of operations using the asset and liability method. Deferred income taxes are recognized by applying enacted statutory tax rates applicable to future years to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases as well as net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. The measurement of deferred tax assets is reduced, if necessary, by a valuation allowance for any tax benefits for which future realization is uncertain. There was no valuation allowance as of December\xa031, 2015 or 2014.\n\nAlthough we believe our assumptions, judgments and estimates are reasonable, changes in tax laws or our interpretation of tax laws and the resolution of any tax audits could significantly impact the amounts provided for income taxes in our consolidated financial statements.\n\nIn evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets, in full or in part, we consider all available positive and negative evidence, including our past operating results, and our forecast of future earnings, future taxable income and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies. The assumptions utilized in determining future taxable income require significant judgment and are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying businesses. Actual operating results in future years could differ from our current assumptions, judgments and estimates. However, we believe that it is more likely than not that substantially all deferred tax assets recorded on our Consolidated Balance Sheets will ultimately be realized. In the event we were to determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets in the future, an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would be charged to earnings in the period in which we make such determination.\n\n  \n\n28', "Table of Contents\n\n  \n\nWe did not recognize certain tax benefits from uncertain tax positions within the provision for income taxes. We may recognize a tax benefit only if it is more likely than not the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such positions are then measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon settlement. At December\xa031, 2015, our estimated gross unrecognized tax benefits were $17.1 million of which $13.5 million, if recognized, would favorably impact our future earnings. Due to uncertainties in any tax audit outcome, our estimates of the ultimate settlement of our unrecognized tax positions may change and the actual tax benefits may differ significantly from the estimates. See Note 10 of Item\xa08, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for further information regarding income taxes.\n\nStock-Based Compensation\n\nWe grant fully vested non-qualified stock options to our employees on a monthly basis. As a result of immediate vesting, stock-based compensation expense is fully recognized on the grant date, and no estimate is required for post-vesting option forfeitures. Stock-based compensation expense at the grant date is based on the total number of options granted and an estimate of the fair value of the awards.\n\nWe calculate the fair value of our stock option grants using a lattice-binomial model. This model requires the input of highly subjective assumptions. Changes in the subjective input assumptions can materially affect the estimate of fair value of options granted and our results of operations could be impacted.\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  |  |\n| • | Expected Volatility: Prior to January 1, 2015, our computation of expected volatility was based on a blend of historical volatility of our common stock and implied volatility of tradable forward call options to purchase shares of our common stock, as low trade volume of our tradable forward call options prior to 2011 precluded sole reliance on implied volatility. Beginning on January 1, 2015, expected volatility is based solely on implied volatility. We believe that implied volatility of publicly traded options in our common stock is more reflective of market conditions and, given consistently high trade volumes of the options, can reasonably be expected to be a better indicator of expected volatility than historical volatility of our common stock. An increase/decrease of 10% in our computation of expected volatility would increase/decrease the total stock-based compensation expense by approximately $10.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. |\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  |  |\n| • | Suboptimal Exercise Factor:\xa0Our computation of the suboptimal exercise factor is based on historical and estimated option exercise behavior. Prior to January 1, 2015, we bifurcated its option grants into two employee groupings (executive and non-executive) to determine the suboptimal exercise factor. Beginning on January 1, 2015, we began aggregating employee groupings for its determination of the suboptimal exercise factor as the previous bifurcation into two groupings did not have a material impact on the fair value of the options granted. An increase/decrease in the suboptimal exercise factor of 10% would increase/decrease the total stock-based compensation expense by approximately $4.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. |\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  |  |\n| Item 7A. | Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk |\n\nWe are exposed to market risks related to interest rate changes and the corresponding changes in the market values of our investments, debt and foreign currency fluctuations.\n\nInterest Rate Risk\n\nThe primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal, while at the same time maximizing income we receive from investments without significantly increased risk. To achieve this objective, we follow an established investment policy and set of guidelines to monitor and help mitigate our exposure to interest rate and credit risk. The policy sets forth credit quality standards and limits our exposure to any one issuer, as well as our maximum exposure to various asset classes. We maintain a portfolio of cash equivalents and short-term investments in a variety of securities. These securities are classified as available-for-sale and are recorded at fair value with unrealized gains and losses, net of tax, included in “Accumulated other comprehensive loss” within Stockholders' equity in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\n\nFor the year ended December\xa031, 2015, we had no impairment charges associated with our short-term investment portfolio. Although we believe our current investment portfolio has very little risk of material impairment, we cannot predict future market conditions or market liquidity and can provide no assurance that our investment portfolio will remain materially unimpaired. Some of the securities we invest in may be subject to market risk due to changes in prevailing interest rates which may cause the principal amount of the investment to fluctuate. For example, if we hold a security that was issued with a fixed interest rate at the then-prevailing rate and the prevailing interest rate later rises, the value of our investment will decline. At December\xa031, 2015, our cash equivalents were generally invested in money market funds, which are not subject to market risk\n\n  \n\n29", 'Table of Contents\n\n  \n\nbecause the interest paid on such funds fluctuates with the prevailing interest rate. Our short-term investments were comprised of corporate debt securities, government and agency securities and asset backed securities.\n\nChanges in interest rates could adversely affect the market value of the securities we hold that are classified as short-term investments. The table below separates these investments, based on stated maturities, to show the approximate exposure to interest rates as of December 31, 2015.\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | | | | |\n|  |  |  |  |  |\n|  |  | (in\xa0thousands) | | |\n| Due within one year |  | $ | 137,927 |  |\n| Due after one year and through 5 years |  | 363,458 | |  |\n| Total |  | $ | 501,385 |  |\n\nA sensitivity analysis was performed on our investment portfolio as of December\xa031, 2015. The analysis is based on an estimate of the hypothetical changes in market value of the portfolio that would result from an immediate parallel shift in the yield curve of various magnitudes. This methodology\xa0assumes a more immediate change in interest rates to reflect the current economic environment.\n\nThe following table presents the hypothetical fair values of our debt securities classified as short-term investments assuming immediate parallel shifts in the yield curve of 50 basis points (“BPS”), 100 BPS and 150 BPS. The analysis is shown as of December\xa031, 2015:\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| Fair Value as of December\xa031, 2015  (in thousands) | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |\n| -150\xa0BPS | | |  | -100 BPS | | |  | -50 BPS | | |  | +50 BPS | | |  | +100\xa0BPS | | |  | +150\xa0BPS | | |\n| $ | 509,125 |  |  | $ | 507,746 |  |  | $ | 504,661 |  |  | $ | 498,103 |  |  | $ | 494,824 |  |  | $ | 491,545 |  |\n\nBased on investment positions as of December 31, 2015, a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates across all maturities would result in a $6.6 million incremental decline in the fair market value of the portfolio. As of December 31, 2014, a similar 100 basis point increase in the yield curve would have resulted in a $5.9 million incremental decline in the fair market value of the portfolio. Such losses would only be realized if the Company sold the investments prior to maturity.\n\nAs of December\xa031, 2015, we had $2.4 billion of debt, consisting of fixed rate unsecured debt in four tranches: $500.0 million of 5.375% notes due in 2021; $400.0 million of 5.750% notes due in 2024; $700.0 million of 5.50% notes due in 2022; and $800.0 million of 5.875% notes due in 2025. The fair value of our debt will fluctuate with movements of interest rates, increasing in periods of declining rates of interest and declining in periods of increasing rates of interest.\n\nForeign Currency Risk\n\nInternational revenues and cost of revenues account for 29% and 39%, respectively of consolidated amounts for the year ended December 31, 2015. The majority of international revenues and a smaller portion of expenses are denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar and we therefore have foreign currency risk related to these currencies, which are primarily the euro, the British pound, the Canadian dollar, the Australian dollar, the Japanese Yen and the Brazilian real.\n\nAccordingly, changes in exchange rates, and in particular a weakening of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar may negatively affect our revenue and contribution profit (loss) of our International streaming segment as expressed in U.S. dollars. For the year ended December 31, 2015, we believe our international revenues would have been approximately $331 million higher had foreign currency exchange rates remained consistent with those for the year ended December 31, 2014.\n\nWe have also experienced and will continue to experience fluctuations in our net income as a result of gains (losses) on the settlement and the remeasurement of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies that are not the functional currency. In the year ended December 31, 2015, we recognized a $37.3 million foreign exchange loss which resulted primarily from the remeasurement of significant content liabilities denominated in currencies other than functional currencies in our European entities coupled with the strengthening of the U.S. dollar.\n\nWe do not use foreign exchange contracts or derivatives to hedge any foreign currency exposures. The volatility of exchange rates depends on many factors that we cannot forecast with reliable accuracy. Our continued international expansion increases our exposure to exchange rate fluctuations and as a result such fluctuations could have a significant impact on our future results of operations.\n\n  \n\n30', 'Table of Contents\n\n  \n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  |  |\n| Item 8. | Financial Statements and Supplementary Data |\n\nThe consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes listed in Part IV, Item\xa015(a)(1) of this Annual Report on Form 10-K are included immediately following Part IV hereof and incorporated by reference herein.\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  |  |\n| Item 9. | Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure |\n\nNone.\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  |  |\n| Item 9A. | Controls and Procedures |\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  |  |\n| (a) | Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures |\n\nOur management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K were effective in providing reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission’s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures.\n\nOur management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal controls will prevent all error and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within Netflix have been detected.\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  |  |\n| (b) | Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting |\n\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as amended (the Exchange Act)). Our management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December\xa031, 2015. In making this assessment, our management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (“COSO”) in Internal Control—Integrated Framework (2013 framework). Based on our assessment under the framework in Internal Control—Integrated Framework (2013 framework), our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December\xa031, 2015.

Netflix, Inc.’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.\n\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\n\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\n\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n\nIn our opinion, Netflix, Inc. maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2015, based on the COSO criteria.\n\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheets of Netflix, Inc. as of December 31, 2015 and 2014, and the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, stockholders’ equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2015 of Netflix, Inc. and our report dated January 28, 2016 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  | |\n|  |  |\n| San Jose, California  January 28, 2016 | /s/ Ernst & Young LLP |\n\n  \n\n32', 'Table of Contents\n\n  \n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  |  |\n| Item 9B. | Other Information |\n\nNone.\n\n  \n\n33', 'Table of Contents\n\n  \n\nPART III\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  |  |\n| Item 10. | Directors, Executive Officers and Corporate Governance |\n\nInformation regarding our directors and executive officers is incorporated by reference from the information contained under the sections “Proposal One: Election of Directors,” “Section 16(a) Beneficial Ownership Compliance” and “Code of Ethics” in our Proxy Statement for the Annual Meeting of Stockholders.\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  |  |\n| Item 11. | Executive Compensation |\n\nInformation required by this item is incorporated by reference from information contained under the section “Compensation of Executive Officers and Other Matters” in our Proxy Statement for the Annual Meeting of Stockholders.\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  |  |\n| Item 12. | Security Ownership of Certain Beneficial Owners and Management and Related Stockholder Matters |\n\nInformation required by this item is incorporated by reference from information contained under the sections “Security Ownership of Certain Beneficial Owners and Management” and “Equity Compensation Plan Information” in our Proxy Statement for the Annual Meeting of Stockholders.\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  |  |\n| Item 13. | Certain Relationships and Related Transactions, and Director Independence |\n\nInformation required by this item is incorporated by reference from information contained under the section “Certain Relationships and Related Transactions” and “Director Independence” in our Proxy Statement for the Annual Meeting of Stockholders.\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  |  |\n| Item 14. | Principal Accounting Fees and Services |\n\nInformation with respect to principal independent registered public accounting firm fees and services is incorporated by reference from the information under the caption “Proposal Two: Ratification of Appointment of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm” in our Proxy Statement for the Annual Meeting of Stockholders.\n\n  \n\n34', 'Table of Contents\n\n  \n\nPART IV\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  |  |\n| Item 15. | Exhibits, Financial Statement Schedules |\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  |  |\n| (a) | The following documents are filed as part of this Annual Report on Form 10-K: |\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  |  |\n| (1) | Financial Statements: |\n\nThe financial statements are filed as part of this Annual Report on Form 10-K under “Item 8.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  |  |\n| 1. | Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies |\n\nDescription of Business\n\nNetflix, Inc. (the “Company”) was incorporated on August\xa029, 1997 and began operations on April\xa014, 1998. The Company is the world’s leading Internet television network with over 75 million streaming members in over 190 countries enjoying more than 125 million hours of hours of TV shows and movies per day, including original series, documentaries and feature films. Members can watch as much as they want, anytime, anywhere, on nearly any Internet-connected screen. Members can play, pause and resume watching, all without commercials or commitments. Additionally, in the United States ("U.S."), members can receive DVDs.\n\nThe Company has three reportable segments, Domestic streaming, International streaming and Domestic DVD. A majority of the Company’s revenues are generated in the United States, and substantially all of the Company’s long-lived tangible assets are held in the United States. The Company’s revenues are derived from monthly membership fees.\n\nBasis of Presentation\n\nThe consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. Intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated.\n\nUse of Estimates\n\nThe preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Significant items subject to such estimates and assumptions include the amortization policy for the streaming content assets; the recognition and measurement of income tax assets and liabilities; and the valuation of stock-based compensation. The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that the Company believes to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates.\n\nStock Split\n\nOn July 14, 2015, the Company completed a\xa0seven-for-one stock split in the form of a stock dividend. References made to outstanding shares or per share amounts in the accompanying consolidated financial statements and applicable disclosures have been retroactively adjusted to reflect this\xa0seven-for-one stock split. The number of authorized shares as reflected on the Consolidated Balance Sheets was not affected by the stock split and accordingly has not been adjusted. See Note\xa08 for additional information.\n\nAccounting Guidance Adopted in 2015\n\nIn April 2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") 2015-05, Customer\'s Accounting for Fees Paid in a Cloud Computing Arrangement, which provides guidance to customers about whether a cloud computing arrangement includes a software license. If a cloud computing arrangement includes a software license, the customer should account for the software license element of the arrangement consistent with the acquisition of other software licenses. If the arrangement does not include a software license, the customer should account for a cloud computing arrangement as a service contract. The Company elected to early adopt the ASU in the third quarter of 2015 and has applied the guidance prospectively to all arrangements. The impact of the adoption of the ASU was not material to the Company\'s consolidated financial statements.\n\nIn April 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-03, Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs which changes the presentation of debt issuance costs in financial statements. ASU 2015-03 requires an entity to present such costs in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the related debt liability rather than as an asset. Amortization of the costs will continue to be reported as interest expense. The Company elected to early adopt ASU 2015-03 as of December 31, 2015, and retrospectively reclassifed $14.2 million of debt issuance costs associated with the Company\'s long-term debt as of December 31, 2014 from other non-current assets to long-term debt.\n\nIn November 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-17, Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes to simplify the presentation of deferred income taxes. The amendments in this update require that deferred tax liabilities and assets be classified as noncurrent in a classified statement of financial position. The Company has elected to early adopt ASU 2015-17 as\n\n  \n\n43', 'Table of Contents\n\n  \n\nof December 31, 2015 and retrospectively applied ASU 2015-17 to all periods presented. As of December 31, 2014 the Company reclassified $13.4 million of deferred tax assets from "Other current assets" to "Other non-current assets" on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\n\nAccounting Guidance Not Yet Adopted\n\nIn May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) which amended the existing accounting standards for revenue recognition. ASU 2014-09 establishes principles for recognizing revenue upon the transfer of promised goods or services to customers, in an amount that reflects the expected consideration received in exchange for those goods or services. In July 2015, the FASB deferred the effective date for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017 (including interim reporting periods within those periods). Early adoption is permitted to the original effective date of December 15, 2016 (including interim reporting periods within those periods). The amendments may be applied retrospectively to each prior period presented or retrospectively with the cumulative effect recognized as of the date of initial application. The Company is currently in the process of evaluating the impact of adoption of the ASU on its consolidated financial statements, but does not expect the impact to be material.\n\nCash Equivalents and Short-term Investments\n\nThe Company considers investments in instruments purchased with an original maturity of 90 days or less to be cash equivalents. The Company also classifies amounts in transit from payment processors for customer credit card and debit card transactions as cash equivalents.\n\nThe Company classifies short-term investments, which consist of marketable securities with original maturities in excess of 90 days as available-for-sale. Short-term investments are reported at fair value with unrealized gains and losses included in “Accumulated other comprehensive loss” within Stockholders’ equity in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The amortization of premiums and discounts on the investments, realized gains and losses, and declines in value judged to be other-than-temporary on available-for-sale securities are included in “Interest and other income (expense)” in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The Company uses the specific identification method to determine cost in calculating realized gains and losses upon the sale of short-term investments.\n\nShort-term investments are reviewed periodically to identify possible other-than-temporary impairment. When evaluating the investments, the Company reviews factors such as the length of time and extent to which fair value has been below cost basis, the financial condition of the issuer, the Company’s intent to sell, or whether it would be more likely than not that the Company would be required to sell the investments before the recovery of their amortized cost basis.\n\nStreaming Content\n\nThe Company acquires, licenses and produces content, including original programming, in order to offer members unlimited viewing of TV shows and films. The content licenses are for a fixed fee and specific windows of availability. Payment terms for certain content licenses and the production of content require more upfront cash payments relative to the amortization expense. Payments for content, including additions to streaming assets and the changes in related liabilities, are classified within "Net cash (used in) provided by operating activities" on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.\n\nFor licenses, the Company capitalizes the fee per title and records a corresponding liability at the gross amount of the liability when the license period begins, the cost of the title is known and the title is accepted and available for streaming. The portion available for streaming within one year is recognized as “Current content assets, net” and the remaining portion as “Non-current content assets, net” on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\n\nFor productions, the Company capitalizes costs associated with the production, including development cost and direct costs. These amounts are included in "Non-current content assets, net" on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Participations and residuals are expensed in line with the amortization of production costs.\n\nBased on factors including historical and estimated viewing patterns, the Company amortizes the content assets (licensed and produced) in “Cost of revenues” on the Consolidated Statements of Operations over the shorter of each title\'s contractual window of availability or estimated period of use, beginning with the month of first availability. The amortization period typically ranges from six months to five years. For most of the content, the Company amortizes on a straight-line basis. For certain content where the Company expects more upfront viewing, due to the additional merchandising and marketing efforts, the amortization is on an accelerated basis. The Company reviews factors impacting the amortization of the content assets on a regular basis, including changes in merchandising and marketing efforts. The Company\'s estimates related to these factors require considerable management judgment.\xa0 Changes in estimates could have a significant impact on the Company\'s future results of operations. In the third quarter of 2015, the Company changed the amortization method of certain content given changes in estimated viewing patterns of this content. The effect of this change in estimate was a $25.5 million decrease in\n\n  \n\n44', 'Table of Contents\n\n  \n\noperating income and a $15.8 million decrease in net income for the year ended December 31, 2015. The effect on both basic earnings per share and diluted earnings per share was a decrease of $0.04 for the year ended December 31, 2015.\n\nContent assets are stated at the lower of unamortized cost or net realizable value which approximates fair value of the capitalized costs for produced content. Content assets are reviewed in aggregate at the operating segment level for write-down when an event or change in circumstances indicates a change in the expected usefulness of the content. Unamortized costs for assets that have been or are expected to be abandoned are written off. No material write-down from unamortized cost to a lower net realizable value was recorded in any of the periods presented.\n\nThe Company has entered into certain licenses with collective management organizations ("CMOs"), and are currently involved in negotiations with other CMOs, that hold certain rights to music and other entertainment works "publicly performed" in connection with streaming content into various territories. Accruals for estimated license fees are recorded and then adjusted based on any changes in estimates. These amounts are included in the streaming content obligations. The results of these negotiations are uncertain and may be materially different from management\'s estimates.\n\nDVD Content\n\nThe Company acquires DVD content for the purpose of renting such content to its domestic DVD members and earning membership rental revenues, and, as such, the Company considers its direct purchase DVD assets to be a productive asset. Accordingly, the Company classifies its DVD assets in “Non-current content assets, net” on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The acquisition of DVD content assets, net of changes in related liabilities, is classified within cash used in investing activities on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows because the DVD content assets are considered a productive asset. Other companies in the in-home entertainment video industry classify these cash flows as operating activities. The Company amortizes its direct purchase DVDs on an accelerated basis over their estimated useful lives, which range from one year to two years. The Company also obtains DVD content through revenue sharing agreements with studios and other content providers. Revenue sharing obligations are expensed as incurred based on shipments.\n\nProperty and Equipment\n\nProperty and equipment are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method over the shorter of the estimated useful lives of the respective assets, generally up to 30 years, or the lease term for leasehold improvements, if applicable. Leased buildings are capitalized and included in property and equipment when the Company was involved in the construction funding and did not meet the “sale-leaseback” criteria.\n\nRevenue Recognition\n\nRevenues are recognized ratably over each monthly membership period. Revenues are presented net of the taxes that are collected from members and remitted to governmental authorities. Deferred revenue consists of membership fees billed that have not been recognized and gift and other prepaid memberships that have not been redeemed.\n\nMarketing\n\nMarketing expenses consist primarily of advertising expenses and also include payments made to the Company’s affiliates and consumer electronics partners. Advertising expenses include promotional activities such as digital and television advertising. Advertising costs are expensed as incurred. Advertising expenses were $714.3 million, $533.1 million and $404.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.\n\nIncome Taxes\n\nThe Company records a provision for income taxes for the anticipated tax consequences of the reported results of operations using the asset and liability method. Deferred income taxes are recognized by applying enacted statutory tax rates applicable to future years to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases as well as net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. The measurement of deferred tax assets is reduced, if necessary, by a valuation allowance for any tax benefits for which future realization is uncertain.\n\nThe Company did not recognize certain tax benefits from uncertain tax positions within the provision for income taxes. The Company may recognize a tax benefit only if it is more likely than not the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such positions are then measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon\n\n  \n\n45', 'Table of Contents\n\n  \n\nsettlement. The Company recognizes interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions in income tax expense. See Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements for further information regarding income taxes.\n\nForeign Currency\n\nThe functional currency for the Company\'s subsidiaries is determined based on the primary economic environment in which the subsidiary operates. The Company translates the assets and liabilities of its non-U.S. dollar functional currency subsidiaries into U.S. dollars using exchange rates in effect at the end of each period. Revenues and expenses for these subsidiaries are translated using rates that approximate those in effect during the period. Gains and losses from these translations are recognized in cumulative translation adjustment included in "Accumulated other comprehensive loss" in Stockholders’ equity on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\n\nPrior to January 1, 2015, the functional currency of certain of the Company\'s European entities was the British pound. The Company changed the functional currency of these entities to the euro effective January 1, 2015 following the redomiciliation of the European headquarters and the launch of the Netflix service in several significant European countries. The change in functional currency was applied prospectively from January 1, 2015. Monetary assets and liabilities have been remeasured to the euro at current exchange rates. Non-monetary assets and liabilities have been remeasured to the euro using the exchange rate effective for the period in which the balance arose. As a result of this change of functional currency, the Company recorded a $21.8 million cumulative translation adjustment included in other comprehensive loss for year ended December 31, 2015.\n\nThe Company remeasures monetary assets and liabilities that are not denominated in the functional currency at exchange rates in effect at the end of each period. Gains and losses from these remeasurements are recognized in interest and other income (expense). Foreign currency transactions resulted in losses of $37.3 million, $8.2 million, and $8.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013 respectively.\n\nEarnings Per Share\n\nIn June 2015, the Company\'s Board of Directors declared a seven-for-one stock split in the form of a stock dividend that was paid on\xa0July 14, 2015\xa0to all shareholders of record as of\xa0July 2, 2015 ("Stock Split").\n\nOutstanding share and per-share amounts disclosed for all periods provided have been retroactively adjusted to reflect the effects of the Stock Split.\n\nBasic earnings per share is computed using the weighted-average number of outstanding shares of common stock during the period. Diluted earnings per share is computed using the weighted-average number of outstanding shares of common stock and, when dilutive, potential common shares outstanding during the period. Potential common shares consist of shares issuable upon the assumed conversion of the Company’s Convertible Notes (prior to the conversion of such notes in April 2013) and incremental shares issuable upon the assumed exercise of stock options. The computation of earnings per share, as adjusted for the Stock Split, is as follows:\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | | | | | | | | | | | |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|  | Year ended December\xa031, | | | | | | | | | | |\n|  | 2015 | | |  | 2014 | | |  | 2013 | | |\n|  | (in\xa0thousands,\xa0except\xa0per\xa0share\xa0data) | | | | | | | | | | |\n| Basic earnings per share: |  | | |  |  | | |  |  | | |\n| Net income | $ | 122,641 |  |  | $ | 266,799 |  |  | $ | 112,403 |  |\n| Shares used in computation: |  | | |  |  | | |  |  | | |\n| Weighted-average common shares outstanding | 425,889 | |  |  | 420,544 | |  |  | 407,385 | |  |\n| Basic earnings per share | $ | 0.29 |  |  | $ | 0.63 |  |  | $ | 0.28 |  |\n| Diluted earnings per share: |  | | |  |  | | |  |  | | |\n| Net income | $ | 122,641 |  |  | $ | 266,799 |  |  | $ | 112,403 |  |\n| Convertible Notes interest expense, net of tax | — | |  |  | — | |  |  | 49 | |  |\n| Numerator for diluted earnings per share | 122,641 | |  |  | 266,799 | |  |  | 112,452 | |  |\n| Shares used in computation: |  | | |  |  | | |  |  | | |\n| Weighted-average common shares outstanding | 425,889 | |  |  | 420,544 | |  |  | 407,385 | |  |\n| Convertible Notes shares | — | |  |  | — | |  |  | 5,007 | |  |\n| Employee stock options | 10,567 | |  |  | 11,350 | |  |  | 12,935 | |  |\n| Weighted-average number of shares | 436,456 | |  |  | 431,894 | |  |  | 425,327 | |  |\n| Diluted earnings per share | $ | 0.28 |  |  | $ | 0.62 |  |  | $ | 0.26 |  |\n\n  \n\n46', 'Table of Contents\n\n  \n\nEmployee stock options with exercise prices greater than the average market price of the common stock were excluded from the diluted calculation as their inclusion would have been anti-dilutive. The following table summarizes the potential common shares excluded from the diluted calculation, as adjusted for the Stock Split:\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | | | | | | | | |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|  | Year\xa0ended\xa0December\xa031, | | | | | | | |\n|  | 2015 | |  | 2014 | |  | 2013 | |\n|  | (in thousands) | | | | | | | |\n| Employee stock options | 517 |  |  | 917 |  |  | 1,386 |  |\n\nStock-Based Compensation\n\nThe Company grants fully vested non-qualified stock options to its employees on a monthly basis. As a result of immediate vesting, stock-based compensation expense is fully recognized on the grant date, and no estimate is required for post-vesting option forfeitures. See Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements for further information regarding stock-based compensation.\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  |  |\n| 2. | Reclassifications |\n\nIn addition to the retrospective adoption of ASU 2015-03 and ASU 2015-17 as detailed in Note 1, certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation in the consolidated financial statements.\n\nSpecifically, the Company reclassified prepaid content from "Other current assets" on the Consolidated Balance Sheets to "Current content assets, net". The reclassifications for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, were $40.4 million and $40.9 million respectively. The Company also reclassified the change in prepaid content of $0.4 million and $19.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively, from "Other current assets" to "Additions to streaming content assets" on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  |  |\n| 3. | Short-term Investments |\n\nThe Company’s investment policy is consistent with the definition of available-for-sale securities. The Company does not buy and hold securities principally for the purpose of selling them in the near future. The Company’s policy is focused on the preservation of capital, liquidity and return. From time to time, the Company may sell certain securities but the objectives are generally not to generate profits on short-term differences in price. The following tables summarize, by major security type, the Company’s assets that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis and are categorized using the fair value hierarchy and where they are classified on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|  | As of December 31, 2015 | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |\n|  | Amortized  Cost | | |  | Gross  Unrealized  Gains | | |  | Gross  Unrealized  Losses | | |  | Estimated  Fair\xa0Value | | |  | Cash and cash equivalents | | |  | Short-term investments | | |  | Non-current assets (1) | | |\n|  | (in thousands) | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |\n| Cash | $ | 1,708,220 |  |  | $ | — |  |  | $ | — |  |  | $ | 1,708,220 |  |  | $ | 1,706,592 |  |  | $ | — |  |  | $ | 1,628 |  |\n| Level 1 securities: |  | | |  |  | | |  |  | | |  |  | | |  |  | | |  |  | | |  |  | | |\n| Money market funds | 107,199 | |  |  | — | |  |  | — | |  |  | 107,199 | |  |  | 102,738 | |  |  | — | |  |  | 4,461 | |  |\n| Level 2 securities: |  | | |  |  | | |  |  | | |  |  | | |  |  | | |  |  | | |  |  | | |\n| Corporate debt securities | 240,867 | |  |  | 154 | |  |  | (409 | | ) |  | 240,612 | |  |  | — | |  |  | 240,612 | |  |  | — | |  |\n| Government securities | 235,252 | |  |  | — | |  |  | (1,046 | | ) |  | 234,206 | |  |  | — | |  |  | 234,206 | |  |  | — | |  |\n| Agency securities | 26,576 | |  |  | — | |  |  | (9 | | ) |  | 26,567 | |  |  | — | |  |  | 26,567 | |  |  | — | |  |\n| Total | $ | 2,318,114 |  |  | $ | 154 |  |  | $ | (1,464 | ) |  | $ | 2,316,804 |  |  | $ | 1,809,330 |  |  | $ | 501,385 |  |  | $ | 6,089 |  |\n\n  \n\n47', 'Table of Contents\n\n  \n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|  | As of December 31, 2014 | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |\n|  | Amortized  Cost | | |  | Gross  Unrealized  Gains | | |  | Gross  Unrealized  Losses | | |  | Estimated  Fair\xa0Value | | |  | Cash and cash equivalents | | |  | Short-term investments | | |  | Non-current assets (1) | | |\n|  | (in thousands) | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |\n| Cash | $ | 1,007,543 |  |  | $ | — |  |  | $ | — |  |  | $ | 1,007,543 |  |  | $ | 1,007,543 |  |  | $ | — |  |  | $ | — |  |\n| Level 1 securities: |  | | |  |  | | |  |  | | |  |  | | |  |  | | |  |  | | |  |  | | |\n| Money market funds | 111,759 | |  |  | — | |  |  | — | |  |  | 111,759 | |  |  | 106,065 | |  |  | — | |  |  | 5,694 | |  |\n| Level 2 securities: |  | | |  |  | | |  |  | | |  |  | | |  |  | | |  |  | | |  |  | | |\n| Corporate debt securities | 295,500 | |  |  | 432 | |  |  | (199 | | ) |  | 295,733 | |  |  | — | |  |  | 295,733 | |  |  | — | |  |\n| Government securities | 168,749 | |  |  | 120 | |  |  | (95 | | ) |  | 168,774 | |  |  | — | |  |  | 168,774 | |  |  | — | |  |\n| Asset and mortgage-backed securities | 112 | |  |  | — | |  |  | — | |  |  | 112 | |  |  | — | |  |  | 112 | |  |  | — | |  |\n| Certificate of deposits | 3,600 | |  |  | — | |  |  | — | |  |  | 3,600 | |  |  | — | |  |  | 3,600 | |  |  | — | |  |\n| Agency securities | 26,665 | |  |  | 5 | |  |  | (1 | | ) |  | 26,669 | |  |  | — | |  |  | 26,669 | |  |  | — | |  |\n| Total | $ | 1,613,928 |  |  | $ | 557 |  |  | $ | (295 | ) |  | $ | 1,614,190 |  |  | $ | 1,113,608 |  |  | $ | 494,888 |  |  | $ | 5,694 |  |\n\n(1) Primarily restricted cash that is related to workers compensation deposits and letter of credit agreements.\n\nFair value is a market-based measurement that should be determined based on the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability. The hierarchy level assigned to each security in the Company’s available-for-sale portfolio and cash equivalents is based on its assessment of the transparency and reliability of the inputs used in the valuation of such instrument at the measurement date. The fair value of available-for-sale securities and cash equivalents included in the Level 1 category is based on quoted prices that are readily and regularly available in an active market. The fair value of available-for-sale securities included in the Level 2 category is based on observable inputs, such as quoted prices for similar assets at the measurement date; quoted prices in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable, either directly or indirectly. These values were obtained from an independent pricing service and were evaluated using pricing models that vary by asset class and may incorporate available trade, bid and other market information and price quotes from well-established independent pricing vendors and broker-dealers. The Company’s procedures include controls to ensure that appropriate fair values are recorded, such as comparing prices obtained from multiple independent sources. See Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements for further information regarding the fair value of the Company’s senior notes.\n\nBecause the Company does not intend to sell the investments that are in an unrealized loss position and it is not likely that the Company will be required to sell any investments before recovery of their amortized cost basis, the Company does not consider those investments with an unrealized loss to be other-than-temporarily impaired at December\xa031, 2015. There were no material other-than-temporary impairments or credit losses related to available-for-sale securities in the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 or 2013.\n\nThere were no material gross realized gains or losses from the sale of available-for-sale investments in the years ended December\xa031, 2015, 2014 and 2013. Realized gains and losses and interest income are included in interest and other income.\n\nThe estimated fair value of short-term investments by contractual maturity as of December\xa031, 2015 is as follows:\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | | | | |\n|  |  |  |  |  |\n|  |  | (in\xa0thousands) | | |\n| Due within one year |  | $ | 137,927 |  |\n| Due after one year and through 5 years |  | 363,458 | |  |\n| Total short-term investments |  | $ | 501,385 |  |\n\n  \n\n48', 'Table of Contents\n\n  \n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  |  |\n| 4. | Balance Sheet Components |\n\nContent Assets\n\nContent assets consisted of the following:\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | | | | | | | |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|  | As of December\xa031, | | | | | | |\n|  | 2015 | | |  | 2014 | | |\n|  | (in thousands) | | | | | | |\n| Total content assets, gross | $ | 12,284,097 |  |  | $ | 8,537,835 |  |\n| Accumulated amortization | (5,065,282 | | ) |  | (3,598,375 | | ) |\n| Total content assets, net | 7,218,815 | |  |  | 4,939,460 | |  |\n| Current content assets, net | 2,905,998 | |  |  | 2,166,134 | |  |\n| Non-current content assets, net | $ | 4,312,817 |  |  | $ | 2,773,326 |  |\n\nThe vast majority of content assets relate to licensed streaming content.

The Company may redeem the Notes prior to maturity in whole or in part at an amount equal to the principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest and an applicable premium. The Notes include, among other terms and conditions, limitations on the Company\'s ability to create, incur or allow certain liens; enter into sale and lease-back transactions; create, assume, incur or guarantee additional indebtedness of certain of the Company\'s subsidiaries; and consolidate or merge with, or convey, transfer or lease all or substantially all of the Company\'s and its subsidiaries assets, to another person. As of December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, the Company was in compliance with all related covenants.\n\nIn November 2011, the Company issued $200.0 million aggregate principal amount of zero coupon senior convertible notes due on December\xa01, 2018 (the “Convertible Notes”) in a private placement offering to TCV VII, L.P., TCV VII(A), L.P., and TCV Member Fund, L.P. A general partner of these funds also serves on the Company’s Board of Directors, and as such, the issuance of the notes is considered a related party transaction. In April 2013, the Company elected to cause the conversion of all outstanding Convertible Notes\xa0in accordance with the terms of the Indenture governing such notes. Pursuant to this conversion, the Company issued\xa016.3 million\xa0shares of common stock to the holders of the Convertible Notes at a conversion ratio of\xa081.5871, as adjusted for the Stock Split. The fair market value of one share of common stock on the date of conversion was\xa0$31.00\xa0per share, as adjusted for the Stock Split.\n\nIn November 2009, the Company issued $200.0 million aggregate principal amount of 8.50% senior notes due November 15, 2017 (the "8.50% Notes"). Interest was payable semi-annually at a rate of 8.50% per annum on May 15 and November 15 of each year. In the first quarter of 2013, the Company redeemed the outstanding\xa0$200.0 million\xa0aggregate principal amount of\xa08.50%\xa0Notes and pursuant to the make-whole provision in the Indenture governing the\xa08.50% Notes, paid a\xa0$19.4 million\xa0premium and\xa0$5.1 million\xa0of accrued and unpaid interest. The Company recognized a loss on extinguishment of debt of\xa0$25.1 million\xa0related to redemption of the\xa08.50%\xa0Notes which included the write off of unamortized debt issuance costs of\xa0$4.2 million.\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  |  |\n| 6. | Commitments and Contingencies |\n\nStreaming Content\n\nAt December 31, 2015, the Company had $10.9 billion of obligations comprised of $2.8 billion included in "Current content liabilities" and $2.0 billion of "Non-current content liabilities" on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and $6.1 billion of obligations that are not reflected on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as they do not yet meet the criteria for asset recognition.\n\nAt December 31, 2014, the Company had $9.5 billion of obligations comprised of $2.1 billion included in "Current content liabilities" and $1.6 billion of "Non-current content liabilities" on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and $5.8 billion of obligations that are not reflected on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as they do not yet meet the criteria for asset recognition.\n\nThe expected timing of payments for these streaming content obligations is as follows:\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | | | | | | | |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|  | As of December 31, | | | | | | |\n|  | 2015 | | |  | 2014 | | |\n|  | (in\xa0thousands) | | | | | | |\n| Less than one year | $ | 4,703,172 |  |  | $ | 3,747,648 |  |\n| Due after one year and through 3 years | 5,249,147 | |  |  | 4,495,103 | |  |\n| Due after 3 years and through 5 years | 891,864 | |  |  | 1,164,308 | |  |\n| Due after 5 years | 58,048 | |  |  | 44,053 | |  |\n| Total streaming content obligations | $ | 10,902,231 |  |  | $ | 9,451,112 |  |\n\n  \n\n50', 'Table of Contents\n\n  \n\nContent obligations include amounts related to the acquisition, licensing and production of content. Obligations that are in non U.S. Dollar currencies are translated to U.S. Dollar at period end rates. A content obligation for the production of original content includes non-cancellable commitments under creative talent and employment agreements. A content obligation for the acquisition and licensing of content is incurred at the time the Company enters into an agreement to obtain future titles. Once a title becomes available, a content liability is generally recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Certain agreements include the obligation to license rights for unknown future titles, the ultimate quantity and/or fees for which are not yet determinable as of the reporting date. Traditional film output deals, like the U.S. output deal with Disney, or certain TV series license agreements where the number of seasons to be aired is unknown, are examples of such license agreements. The Company does not include any estimated obligation for these future titles beyond the known minimum amount. However, the unknown obligations are expected to be significant.\n\nLease obligations\n\nThe Company leases facilities under non-cancelable operating leases with various expiration dates through 2028. Several lease agreements contain rent escalation clauses or rent holidays. For purposes of recognizing minimum rental expenses on a straight-line basis over the terms of the leases, the Company uses the date of initial possession to begin amortization, which is generally when the Company enters the space and begins to make improvements in preparation for intended use. For scheduled rent escalation clauses during the lease terms or for rental payments commencing at a date other than the date of initial occupancy, the Company records minimum rental expenses on a straight-line basis over the terms of the leases in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The Company has the option to extend or renew most of its leases which may increase the future minimum lease commitments.\n\nBecause the terms of the Company’s facilities lease agreements for its original Los Gatos, California headquarters site required the Company’s involvement in the construction funding of the buildings, the Company is the “deemed owner” (for accounting purposes only) of these buildings. Accordingly, the Company recorded an asset of $40.7 million, representing the total costs of the buildings and improvements, including the costs paid by the lessor (the legal owner of the buildings), with corresponding liabilities. Upon completion of construction of each building, the Company did not meet the sale-leaseback criteria for de-recognition of the building assets and liabilities. Therefore the leases are accounted for as financing obligations.\n\nIn the third quarter of 2015, the Company extended the facilities leases for the original Los Gatos buildings for an additional three years term, increasing the future minimum payments under the lease financing obligations by approximately $13.7 million. In this extension, the leases continue to be accounted for as financing obligations and no gain or loss was recorded as a result of the lease financing modification. At December\xa031, 2015, the lease financing obligation balance was $29.0 million, the majority of which is recorded in “Other non-current liabilities,” on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The remaining future minimum payments under the lease financing obligation are $21.1 million. The lease financing obligation balance at the end of the extended lease term will be approximately $21.8 million which approximates the net book value of the buildings to be relinquished to the lessor.\n\nIn addition to the lease financing obligation, future minimum lease payments include $428.7 million as of December 31, 2015 related to non-cancelable operating leases for the expanded headquarters in Los Gatos, California and the new office space in Los Angeles, California.\n\nFuture minimum payments under lease financing obligations and non-cancelable operating leases as of December\xa031, 2015 are as follows:\n\n|  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | | | |\n|  |  |  |  |\n| Year Ending December\xa031, | Future  Minimum  Payments | | |\n|  | (in\xa0thousands) | | |\n| 2016 | $ | 42,545 |  |\n| 2017 | 54,811 | |  |\n| 2018 | 58,015 | |  |\n| 2019 | 53,152 | |  |\n| 2020 | 51,844 | |  |\n| Thereafter | 269,377 | |  |\n| Total minimum payments | $ | 529,744 |  |\n\n  \n\n51', "Table of Contents\n\n  \n\nRent expense associated with the operating leases was $34.7 million, $26.6 million and $27.9 million for the years ended December\xa031, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.\n\nLegal Proceedings\n\nFrom time to time, in the normal course of its operations, the Company is subject to litigation matters and claims, including claims relating to employee relations, business practices and patent infringement. Litigation can be expensive and disruptive to normal business operations. Moreover, the results of complex legal proceedings are difficult to predict and the Company's view of these matters may change in the future as the litigation and events related thereto unfold. The Company expenses legal fees as incurred. The Company records a provision for contingent losses when it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. An unfavorable outcome to any legal matter, if material, could have an adverse effect on the Company's operations or its financial position, liquidity or results of operations.\n\nOn January 13, 2012, the first of\xa0three\xa0purported shareholder class action lawsuits was filed in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California against the Company and certain of its officers and directors. Two additional purported shareholder class action lawsuits were filed in the same court on January 27, 2012 and February 29, 2012 alleging substantially similar claims. \xa0These lawsuits were consolidated into\xa0In re Netflix, Inc., Securities Litigation, Case No.\xa03:12-cv-00225-SC, and the Court selected lead plaintiffs. On June 26, 2012, lead plaintiffs filed a consolidated complaint which alleged violations of the federal securities laws. The Court dismissed the consolidated complaint with leave to amend on February 13, 2013. Lead plaintiffs filed a first amended consolidated complaint on March 22, 2013. The Court dismissed the first amended consolidated complaint with prejudice on August 20, 2013, and judgment was entered on September 27, 2013. Lead plaintiffs filed a motion to alter or amend the judgment and requested leave to file a second amended complaint on October 25, 2013. On January 17, 2014, the Court denied that motion. On February 18, 2014, lead plaintiffs appealed that decision to the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, oral argument has been set for March 17, 2016. Management has determined a potential loss is reasonably possible however, based on its current knowledge, management does not believe that the amount of such possible loss or a range of potential loss is reasonably estimable.\n\nOn November 23, 2011, the first of\xa0six\xa0purported shareholder derivative suits was filed in the Superior Court of California, Santa Clara County, against the Company and certain of its officers and directors. Five additional purported shareholder derivative suits were subsequently filed: two in the Superior Court of California, Santa Clara County on February 9, 2012 and May 2, 2012; and three in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California on February 13, 2012, February 24, 2012 and April 2, 2012. The purported shareholder derivative suits filed in the Northern District of California have been voluntarily dismissed. On July 5, 2012, the purported shareholder derivative suits filed in Santa Clara County were consolidated into\xa0In re Netflix, Inc. Shareholder Derivative Litigation, Case No. 1-12-cv-218399, and lead counsel was appointed. A consolidated complaint was filed on December 4, 2012, with plaintiffs seeking compensatory damages and other relief. The consolidated complaint alleges, among other things, that certain of the Company's current and former officers and directors breached their fiduciary duties, issued false and misleading statements primarily regarding the Company's streaming business, violated accounting rules concerning segment reporting, violated provisions of the California Corporations Code, and wasted corporate assets. The consolidated complaint further alleges that the defendants caused the Company to buy back stock at artificially inflated prices to the detriment of the Company and its shareholders while contemporaneously selling personally held Company stock. The Company filed a demurrer to the consolidated complaint and a motion to stay the derivative litigation in favor of the related federal securities class action on February 4, 2013. On June 21, 2013, the Court granted the motion to stay the derivative litigation pending resolution of the related federal securities class action. Management has determined a potential loss is reasonably possible however, based on its current knowledge, management does not believe that the amount of such possible loss or a range of potential loss is reasonably estimable.\n\nThe Company is involved in other litigation matters not listed above but does not consider the matters to be material either individually or in the aggregate at this time. The Company's view of the matters not listed may change in the future as the litigation and events related thereto unfold.\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  |  |\n| 7. | Guarantees—Indemnification Obligations |\n\nIn the ordinary course of business, the Company has entered into contractual arrangements under which it has agreed to provide indemnification of varying scope and terms to business partners and other parties with respect to certain matters, including, but not limited to, losses arising out of the Company’s breach of such agreements and out of intellectual property infringement claims made by third parties. In these circumstances, payment may be conditional on the other party making a claim pursuant to the procedures specified in the particular contract.\n\nThe Company’s obligations under these agreements may be limited in terms of time or amount, and in some instances, the Company may have recourse against third parties for certain payments. In addition, the Company has entered into\n\n  \n\n52", "Table of Contents\n\n  \n\nindemnification agreements with its directors and certain of its officers that will require it, among other things, to indemnify them against certain liabilities that may arise by reason of their status or service as directors or officers. The terms of such obligations vary.\n\nIt is not possible to make a reasonable estimate of the maximum potential amount of future payments under these or similar agreements due to the conditional nature of the Company’s obligations and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular agreement. No amount has been accrued in the accompanying financial statements with respect to these indemnification guarantees.\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  |  |\n| 8. | Stockholders’ Equity |\n\nIn April 2013, the Company issued\xa016.3 million\xa0shares of common stock in connection with the conversion of the Convertible Notes, as adjusted for the Stock Split. See Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements for further details.\n\nStock Split\n\nIn March 2015, the Company's Board of Directors adopted an amendment to the Company's Certificate of Incorporation, to increase the number of shares of capital stock the Company is authorized to issue from 170,000,000 (160,000,000 shares of common stock and 10,000,000 shares of preferred stock), par value $0.001 to 5,000,000,000 (4,990,000,000 shares of common stock and 10,000,000 shares of preferred stock), par value $0.001. This amendment to the Company's certificate of incorporation was approved by the Company's stockholders at the 2015 Annual Meeting held on June 9, 2015.\n\nOn June 23, 2015, the Company's Board of Directors\xa0declared a seven-for-one stock split in the form of a stock dividend that was paid on\xa0July 14, 2015\xa0to all shareholders of record as of\xa0July 2, 2015. Outstanding share and per-share amounts disclosed for all periods presented have been retroactively adjusted to reflect the effects of the Stock Split.\n\nPreferred Stock\n\nThe Company has authorized 10,000,000 shares of undesignated preferred stock with a par value of $0.001 per share. None of the preferred shares were issued and outstanding at December\xa031, 2015 and 2014.\n\nVoting Rights\n\nThe holders of each share of common stock shall be entitled to one vote per share on all matters to be voted upon by the Company’s stockholders.\n\nStock Option Plans\n\nIn June 2011, the Company adopted the 2011 Stock Plan. The 2011 Stock Plan provides for the grant of incentive stock options to employees and for the grant of non-statutory stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock and restricted stock units to employees, directors and consultants. As of December\xa031, 2015, 16.8 million shares were reserved for future grants under the 2011 Stock Plan.\n\n  \n\n53", "Table of Contents\n\n  \n\nA summary of the activities related to the Company’s stock option plans, as adjusted for the Stock Split, is as follows:\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|  | Shares\xa0Available  for Grant | |  | Options Outstanding | | | | | |  | Weighted- Average Remaining Contractual Term (in\xa0Years) |  | Aggregate  Intrinsic\xa0Value  (in\xa0Thousands) | | |\n|  | Number of  Shares | |  | Weighted- Average Exercise Price  (per Share) | | |  |\n| Balances as of December\xa031, 2012 | 28,343,259 |  |  | 32,010,664 |  |  | $ | 10.19 |  |  |  |  |  | | |\n| Granted | (4,499,040 | ) |  | 4,499,040 |  |  | 29.85 | |  |  |  |  |  | | |\n| Exercised | — |  |  | (11,821,418 | ) |  | 10.54 | |  |  |  |  |  | | |\n| Balances as of December\xa031, 2013 | 23,844,219 |  |  | 24,688,286 |  |  | $ | 13.61 |  |  |  |  |  | | |\n| Granted | (3,819,011 | ) |  | 3,819,011 |  |  | 57.55 | |  |  |  |  |  | | |\n| Exercised | — |  |  | (5,661,880 | ) |  | 10.81 | |  |  |  |  |  | | |\n| Balances as of December\xa031, 2014 | 20,025,208 |  |  | 22,845,417 |  |  | $ | 21.65 |  |  |  |  |  | | |\n| Granted | (3,179,892 | ) |  | 3,179,892 |  |  | 82.67 | |  |  |  |  |  | | |\n| Exercised | — |  |  | (5,029,553 | ) |  | 15.38 | |  |  |  |  |  | | |\n| Balances as of December\xa031, 2015 | 16,845,316 |  |  | 20,995,756 |  |  | $ | 32.39 |  |  | 6.26 |  | $ | 1,723,505 |  |\n| Vested and exercisable at  December\xa031, 2015 |  | |  | 20,995,756 |  |  | $ | 32.39 |  |  | 6.26 |  | $ | 1,723,505 |  |\n\nThe aggregate intrinsic value in the table above represents the total pretax intrinsic value (the difference between the Company’s closing stock price on the last trading day of 2015 and the exercise price, multiplied by the number of in-the-money options) that would have been received by the option holders had all option holders exercised their options on the last trading day of 2015. This amount changes based on the fair market value of the Company’s common stock. Total intrinsic value of options exercised for the years ended December\xa031, 2015, 2014 and 2013 was $368.4 million, $265.1 million and $274.2 million, respectively.\n\nCash received from option exercises for the years ended December\xa031, 2015, 2014 and 2013 was $78.0 million, $60.5 million and $124.6 million, respectively.\n\nStock-Based Compensation\n\nVested stock options granted after June\xa030, 2004 and before January\xa01, 2007 can be exercised up to one year following termination of employment. Vested stock options granted after January 2007 will remain exercisable for the full ten year contractual term regardless of employment status. The following table summarizes the assumptions used to value option grants using the lattice-binomial model and the valuation data, as adjusted for the Stock Split:\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | | | | | | | | | | | | |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|  |  | Year\xa0Ended\xa0December\xa031, | | | | | | | | | | |\n|  |  | 2015 | | |  | 2014 | | |  | 2013 | | |\n| Dividend yield |  | — | | % |  | — | | % |  | — | | % |\n| Expected volatility |  | 36% - 53% | |  |  | 41% - 48% | |  |  | 51% - 54% | |  |\n| Risk-free interest rate |  | 2.03% - 2.29% | |  |  | 2.39% - 2.83% | |  |  | 1.87% - 2.71% | |  |\n| Suboptimal exercise factor |  | 2.47 - 2.48 | |  |  | 2.66 - 5.44 | |  |  | 2.33 - 3.92 | |  |\n| Valuation data: |  |  | | |  |  | | |  |  | | |\n| Weighted-average fair value (per share) |  | $ | 39.22 |  |  | $ | 30.17 |  |  | $ | 16.25 |  |\n| Total stock-based compensation expense (in thousands) |  | 124,725 | |  |  | 115,239 | |  |  | 73,100 | |  |\n| Total income tax impact on provision (in thousands) |  | 47,125 | |  |  | 43,999 | |  |  | 28,096 | |  |\n\nThe Company considers several factors in determining the suboptimal exercise factor, including the historical and estimated option exercise behavior and the employee groupings. Prior to January 1, 2015, the Company bifurcated its option grants into two employee groupings (executive and non-executive) to determine the suboptimal exercise factor. Beginning on January 1, 2015, the Company began aggregating employee groupings for its determination of the suboptimal exercise factor as the previous bifurcation into two groupings did not have a material impact on the fair value of the options granted.\n\nPrior to January 1, 2015, the Company's computation of expected volatility was based on a blend of historical volatility of its common stock and implied volatility of tradable forward call options to purchase shares of its common stock, as low trade\n\n  \n\n54", 'Table of Contents\n\n  \n\nvolume of its tradable forward call options prior to 2011 precluded sole reliance on implied volatility. Beginning on January 1, 2015, expected volatility is based solely on implied volatility. The Company believes that implied volatility of publicly traded options in its common stock is more reflective of market conditions, and given consistently high trade volumes of the options, can reasonably be expected to be a better indicator of expected volatility than historical volatility of its common stock.\n\nIn valuing shares issued under the Company’s employee stock option plans, the Company bases the risk-free interest rate on U.S. Treasury zero-coupon issues with terms similar to the contractual term of the options. The Company does not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future and therefore uses an expected dividend yield of\xa0zero\xa0in the option valuation model. The Company does not use a post-vesting termination rate as options are fully vested upon grant date.\n\n9.

The Company intends to reinvest these earnings indefinitely in its foreign subsidiaries. If these earnings were distributed to the United States in the form of dividends or otherwise, the Company would be subject to additional U.S. income taxes net of available foreign tax credits associated with these earnings. The amount of unrecognized deferred income tax liability related to these earnings is approximately $22.8 million.\n\nA reconciliation of the provision for income taxes, with the amount computed by applying the statutory Federal income tax rate to income before income taxes is as follows:\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | | | | | | | | | | | |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|  | Year Ended December\xa031, | | | | | | | | | | |\n|  | 2015 | | |  | 2014 | | |  | 2013 | | |\n|  | (in thousands) | | | | | | | | | | |\n| Expected tax expense at U.S. Federal statutory rate of 35% | $ | 49,658 |  |  | $ | 122,279 |  |  | $ | 59,878 |  |\n| State income taxes, net of Federal income tax effect | 4,783 | |  |  | 13,274 | |  |  | 8,053 | |  |\n| R&D tax credit | (29,363 | | ) |  | (18,655 | | ) |  | (13,841 | | ) |\n| Release of tax reserves on previously unrecognized tax benefits | (13,438 | | ) |  | (38,612 | | ) |  | — | |  |\n| Foreign earnings at other than US rates | 5,310 | |  |  | 2,959 | |  |  | 821 | |  |\n| Other | 2,294 | |  |  | 1,325 | |  |  | 3,760 | |  |\n| Provision for income taxes | $ | 19,244 |  |  | $ | 82,570 |  |  | $ | 58,671 |  |\n\nOn December 18, 2015, the Protecting Americans from Tax Hikes Act of 2015 (H.R. 2029) was signed into law which retroactively and permanently extended the Federal R&D credit from January 1, 2015. As a result, the Company recognized the retroactive benefit of the 2015 R&D credit of approximately $16.5 million as a discrete item in the fourth quarter of 2015, the period in which the legislation was enacted.\n\n  \n\n56', 'Table of Contents\n\n  \n\nThe components of deferred tax assets and liabilities were as follows:\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | | | | | | | |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|  | As of\xa0December\xa031, | | | | | | |\n|  | 2015 | | |  | 2014 | | |\n|  | (in thousands) | | | | | | |\n| Deferred tax assets (liabilities): |  | | |  |  | | |\n| Stock-based compensation | $ | 131,339 |  |  | $ | 100,397 |  |\n| Accruals and reserves | 14,367 | |  |  | 13,415 | |  |\n| Depreciation and amortization | (43,204 | | ) |  | (11,708 | | ) |\n| R&D credits | 74,091 | |  |  | 21,014 | |  |\n| Other | 3,980 | |  |  | (2,778 | | ) |\n| Total deferred tax assets | $ | 180,573 |  |  | $ | 120,340 |  |\n\nAll deferred tax assets are classified as “Other non-current assets” on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014. In evaluating its ability to realize the net deferred tax assets, the Company considered all available positive and negative evidence, including its past operating results and the forecast of future market growth, forecasted earnings, future taxable income, and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies. As of December\xa031, 2015 and 2014, it was considered more likely than not that substantially all deferred tax assets would be realized, and no valuation allowance was recorded.\n\nAs of December\xa031, 2015, the Company\'s Federal R&D tax credit and state tax credit carryforwards for tax return purposes were $44.1 million, and $59.3 million, respectively. The Federal R&D tax credit carryforwards expire through 2035. State tax credit carryforwards of $58.8 million can be carried forward indefinitely and $0.5 million expire in 2024.\n\nAs of December 31, 2015, the Company’s net operating loss carryforwards for Federal and state tax return purposes were $104.8 million and $237.0 million, respectively, which expire in 2035. These net operating losses were generated as a result of excess stock option deductions. Pursuant to Accounting Standards Codification 718, Compensation - Stock Compensation , the Company has not recognized the related $45.0 million tax benefit from the Federal and state net operating losses attributable to excess stock option deductions in gross deferred tax assets. The $45.0 million tax benefit will be credited directly to additional paid-in capital when net operating losses attributable to excess stock option deductions are utilized to reduce taxes payable.\n\nIncome tax benefits attributable to the exercise of employee stock options of $79.9 million, $88.9 million and $80.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively, were recorded directly to additional paid-in-capital.\n\nThe Company classified $3.6 million of unrecognized tax benefits that are expected to result in payment or receipt of cash within one year as “Accrued expenses”. The unrecognized tax benefits that are not expected to result in payment or receipt of cash within one year are classified as “Other non-current liabilities” and a reduction of deferred tax assets which is classified as "Other non-current assets" in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of December\xa031, 2015, the total amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits was $17.1 million, of which $13.5 million, if recognized, would favorably impact the Company’s effective tax rate. As of\xa0December\xa031, 2014, the total amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits was $34.8 million, of which\xa0$29.2 million, if recognized, would favorably impact the Company’s effective tax rate. The aggregate changes in the Company’s total gross amount of unrecognized tax benefits are summarized as follows (in thousands):\n\n|  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | | | |\n|  |  |  |  |\n| Balance as of December\xa031, 2013 | $ | 68,231 |  |\n| Decreases related to tax positions taken during prior periods | (39,015 | | ) |\n| Increases related to tax positions taken during the current period | 11,174 | |  |\n| Decreases related to settlements with taxing authorities | (5,578 | | ) |\n| Balance as of December\xa031, 2014 | $ | 34,812 |  |\n| Increases related to tax positions taken during prior periods | 1,960 | |  |\n| Decreases related to tax positions taken during prior periods | (12,334 | | ) |\n| Increases related to tax positions taken during the current period | 7,077 | |  |\n| Decreases related to settlements with taxing authorities | (14,398 | | ) |\n| Balance as of December\xa031, 2015 | $ | 17,117 |  |\n\n  \n\n57', 'Table of Contents\n\n  \n\nThe Company includes interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits within the provision for income taxes and in “Other non-current liabilities” in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Interest and penalties included in the Company\'s provision for income taxes were not material in all the periods presented.\n\nThe Company files U.S. Federal, state and foreign tax returns. In December 2015, the Company reached a settlement with the IRS for tax years 2010 through 2013. The 2014 Federal tax return remains subject to examination by the IRS. California had previously completed its Field Exam of the 2006 and 2007 California tax returns and had issued a Notice of Proposed Assessment primarily related to the Company\'s R&D Credits claimed in those years. The Company filed a protest against the proposed assessment and settlement was reached with the Franchise Tax Board for tax years 1997 through 2007 in November 2015. The years 2008 through 2014, remain subject to examination by the state of California. As a result of the above audit settlements, the Company has reassessed the tax reserves on the related uncertain tax position for all open years and released $13.4 million of tax reserves in the fourth quarter of 2015. The Company has no significant foreign jurisdiction audits underway. The years 2011 through 2014 remain subject to examination by foreign jurisdictions.\n\nGiven the potential outcome of the current examinations as well as the impact of the current examinations on the potential expiration of the statute of limitations, it is reasonably possible that the balance of unrecognized tax benefits could significantly change within the next twelve months. However, an estimate of the range of reasonably possible adjustments cannot be made.\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  |  |\n| 11. | Employee Benefit Plan |\n\nThe Company maintains a 401(k) savings plan covering substantially all of its employees. Eligible employees may contribute up to 60% of their annual salary through payroll deductions, but not more than the statutory limits set by the Internal Revenue Service. The Company matches employee contributions at the discretion of the Board. During 2015, 2014 and 2013, the Company’s matching contributions totaled $11.2 million, $8.3 million and $6.5 million, respectively.\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  |  |\n| 12. | Segment Information |\n\nThe Company has three reportable segments: Domestic streaming, International streaming and Domestic DVD. Segment information is presented along the same lines that the Company’s chief operating decision maker ("CODM") reviews the operating results in assessing performance and allocating resources. The Company’s CODM reviews revenue and contribution profit (loss) for each of the reportable segments. Contribution profit (loss) is defined as revenues less cost of revenues and marketing expenses incurred by the segment. The Company has aggregated the results of the International operating segments into one reportable segment because these operating segments share similar long-term economic and other qualitative characteristics.\n\nThe Domestic streaming segment derives revenues from monthly membership fees for services consisting solely of streaming content to the members in the United States. The International streaming segment derives revenues from monthly membership fees for services consisting solely of streaming content to members outside of the United States. The Domestic DVD segment derives revenues from monthly membership fees for services consisting solely of DVD-by-mail. Revenues and the related payment card fees are attributed to the operating segment based on the nature of the underlying membership (streaming or DVD) and the geographic region from which the membership originates. There are no internal revenue transactions between the Company’s segments.\n\nThe majority of cost of revenues relate to content expenses directly incurred by the segment. However, in connection with global expansion, content acquired, licensed, and produced increasingly includes global rights. The Company allocates this content between the International and Domestic streaming segments based on estimated fair market value. Other costs of revenues such as delivery costs are primarily attributed to the operating segment based on amounts directly incurred by the segment. Marketing expenses consist primarily of advertising expenses and payments made to our affiliates and device partners which are generally included in the segment in which the expenditures are directly incurred.\n\nThe Company\'s long-lived tangible assets were located as follows:\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | | | | | | | |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |

Memberships are assigned to territories based on the geographic location used at time of sign-up as determined by our internal systems, which utilize industry standard geo-location technology. We offer free-trial memberships to new and certain rejoining members. Total members include those who are on a free-trial as long as a method of payment has been provided. A membership is canceled and ceases to be reflected in the above metrics as of the effective cancellation date. Voluntary cancellations become effective at the end of the prepaid membership period, while involuntary cancellation of the service, as a result of a failed method of payment, becomes effective immediately except in limited circumstances where a short grace period is offered to ensure the streaming service is not interrupted for members who are impacted by payment processing delays by our banks or integrated payment partners. The number of members in a grace period at any given point is not material. |\n\n  \n\n60', 'Table of Contents\n\n  \n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  |  |\n| 13. | Selected Quarterly Financial Data (Unaudited) |\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|  | December\xa031 | | |  | September\xa030 | | |  | June\xa030 | | |  | March\xa031 | | |\n|  | (in thousands, except for per share data) | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |\n| 2015 |  | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |\n| Total revenues | $ | 1,823,333 |  |  | $ | 1,738,355 |  |  | $ | 1,644,694 |  |  | $ | 1,573,129 |  |\n| Gross profit | 573,968 | |  |  | 564,397 | |  |  | 522,942 | |  |  | 526,728 | |  |\n| Net income | 43,178 | |  |  | 29,432 | |  |  | 26,335 | |  |  | 23,696 | |  |\n| Earnings per share: |  | | |  |  | | |  |  | | |  |  | | |\n| Basic | $ | 0.10 |  |  | $ | 0.07 |  |  | $ | 0.06 |  |  | $ | 0.06 |  |\n| Diluted | 0.10 | |  |  | 0.07 | |  |  | 0.06 | |  |  | 0.05 | |  |\n| 2014 |  | | |  |  | | |  |  | | |  |  | | |\n| Total revenues | $ | 1,484,728 |  |  | $ | 1,409,432 |  |  | $ | 1,340,407 |  |  | $ | 1,270,089 |  |\n| Gross profit | 470,396 | |  |  | 455,038 | |  |  | 425,559 | |  |  | 400,903 | |  |\n| Net income | 83,371 | |  |  | 59,295 | |  |  | 71,018 | |  |  | 53,115 | |  |\n| Earnings per share: |  | | |  |  | | |  |  | | |  |  | | |\n| Basic | $ | 0.20 |  |  | $ | 0.14 |  |  | $ | 0.17 |  |  | $ | 0.13 |  |\n| Diluted | 0.19 | |  |  | 0.14 | |  |  | 0.16 | |  |  | 0.12 | |  |\n\n  \n\n61', 'Table of Contents\n\n  \n\nSIGNATURES\n\nPursuant to the requirements of Section\xa013 or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned, thereunto duly authorized.\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | | | | |\n|  |  |  |  |  |\n|  |  | Netflix, Inc. | | |\n|  |  |  |  |  |\n| Dated: January 28, 2016 |  | By: |  | /S/\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0REED\xa0HASTINGS |\n|  |  |  |  | Reed Hastings  Chief Executive Officer  (principal executive officer) |\n|  |  |  |  |  |\n| Dated: January 28, 2016 |  | By: |  | /S/\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0DAVID\xa0WELLS |\n|  |  |  |  | David Wells  Chief Financial Officer  (principal financial and accounting officer) |\n\n  \n\n62', 'Table of Contents\n\n  \n\nPOWER OF ATTORNEY\n\nKNOWN ALL PERSONS BY THESE PRESENTS, that each person whose signature appears below constitutes and appoints Reed Hastings and David Wells, and each of them, as his true and lawful attorneys-in-fact and agents, with full power of substitution and resubstitution, for him and in his name, place, and stead, in any and all capacities, to sign any and all amendments to this Report, and to file the same, with all exhibits thereto, and other documents in connection therewith, with the Securities and Exchange Commission, granting unto said attorneys-in-fact and agents, and each of them, full power and authority to do and perform each and every act and thing requisite and necessary to be done in connection therewith, as fully to all intents and purposes as he might or could do in person, hereby ratifying and confirming that all said attorneys-in-fact and agents, or any of them or their or his substitute or substituted, may lawfully do or cause to be done by virtue thereof.\n\nPursuant to the requirements of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, this Annual Report on Form 10-K has been signed below by the following persons on behalf of the registrant and in the capacities and on the dates indicated.\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | | | | |\n|  |  |  |  |  |\n| Signature |  | Title |  | Date |\n| /S/\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0REED\xa0HASTINGS |  | President,\xa0Chief\xa0Executive\xa0Officer and Director (principal executive officer) |  | January\xa028, 2016 |\n| Reed Hastings |  |  |\n|  |  |  |  |  |\n| /S/\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0DAVID\xa0WELLS |  | Chief Financial Officer (principal financial and accounting officer) |  | January\xa028, 2016 |\n| David Wells |  |  |\n|  |  |  |  |  |\n| /S/\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0RICHARD\xa0BARTON |  | Director |  | January\xa028, 2016 |\n| Richard Barton |  |  |\n|  |  |  |  |  |\n| /S/\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0TIMOTHY\xa0M.
